       "   u'Content': u'The USPs of this hotel are the central location, the free apples and the unlimited supply of drinking water. That is quite something. The rooms are comfortable though small. The bathroom and the linen are clean. The reception assistance is very good, everybody speaking English . Any number of good eateries and food marts around. Walking distance to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya. Best advantage is the Caixa Calunya Square where the sight seeing buses have their major stop which is barely a few steps away. For a couple discovering the city on its own, that is a blessing. Because of the narrow lanes and the pubs below, the place is vibrant throughout the night Obviously ,be prepared to hear loud noises till the wee hours of the morning.',\n",

The price is ok and the rooms (please note that I have only stayed in suits but have them been 3 persons) are big and nicely decorated. The service is ok but dont expect lots of extras. Even the breakfast for about 10 euro wasn't too bad. I have stayed here twice (2005 and 2012) and would stay here again. If u do stay here make sure you go to sagardi for Pinxos and drinks.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'We felt that Hotel Banys was simply an average property that has its location to thank for its popularity and maybe some past glory. We found the hotel staff to be a bit aloof. Their attitude only changed when we told them we would be checking out. Our room was dingy, the bathroom dark and lacked adequate lighting. The spring-loaded door wouldn\\'t allow you to even keep the bathroom door open. The walls, and doors could have used a bit of attention with a fresh coat of paint and the furniture was a bit scuffed. The bed was hard and the mattress had seen better days. The small \"toilet room\" smelled as if it had not been cleaned from the previous guest. Hotel hallways were dark as well. As other reviews have mentioned, rooms in the front of the hotel can get loud but nothing that a pair of earplugs can\\'t take care of. Overall, this hotel did not meet our expectations so we left after one night to find accommodations more suited to our liking.',\n",

Much bigger than average hotel room, but facilities were limited and rooms were not equipped according to luxyry standard - good and comfortable but not luxury. There is a good restaurant next to the small lobby. Much of the action and sights are close-by, very good location.',\n",

Very nicely furnished and a great comfortable feel to it. Located close enough to some major sights, we still managed to walk just about everywhere (but Barcelona is a big city so be warned that fitness and comfortable shoes are needed if you plan to walk). A very nice restaurant within the hotel, if not a little expensive but it was a 5* restaurant. 9/10 for food, quality, taste, presentation and service. Very close to some great off the beaten path restaurants.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I stayed at this hotel last weekend. The staff were extremely helpful, making restaurant bookings, giving directions and advice etc. The rooms are small and a bit sombre, so I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic break.I just needed somehwere clean and central to sleep and it served its purpose. It is indeed a great location, at the start of El Born, near the metro station (Jaume), buses and a taxi stance. If you are a keen walker you can walk practically everywhere (beach, main shopping areas and sites in city centre) from there. I did not try the breakfast, or the restauarant, which I've heard is rather good.The rooms at the back are apparently quieter but smaller and darker. The shower is big and the hotel provides a trousse of toiletries. Also welcome is the free mineral water and fruit in the corridors to which guests can help themselves. The only improvement I would make is tea/coffee making facilities since there is no room service for breakfast. Some of us need a cuppa before we get dressed!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'We liked this hotel, although it offered no amenities, other than unlimited free bottled water and fresh apples in a bowl in the hallway. There is no lobby to speak of, but the room is a good size, the bed comfortable and free wi-fi. The location could not be better; the hotel is convenient to everything a tourist would want to do in Barcelona. Not all of the staff at the front desk spoke English, but they did try to be helpful. There is no full length mirror anywhere in the room, and the wooden floors in the hallways certainly carried the noise of anyone walking there at night. There is a well respected restaurant in the hotel, but apparently not really affiliated with it, which we thought was only fair and not up to its reputation. Our room had a double glass door opening onto a tiny balcony looking into an alleyway, which made our room rather dark. The furniture was modern just as the hotel photos show. All in all, we would recommend this hotel primarily for its terrific location.',\n",

You get to stay in an historic building that's hundreds of years old, yet it's tastefully done and very modern in its facilities. It feels safe there too (good locks, and every room has a safe) which is important in crime-ridden Barcelona. Great staff, a good breakfast (chargeable), and a high quality restaurant onsite too. Don't expect to park anywhere near, and you have to walk to a main road to get any transit or a taxi. There is WiFi but it's poor (as would be expected with those dense buildings and thick walls). However overall it's top quality accommodation.\",\n",

I guess the person/company who booked the room for me had some extra price for it.... I hear that all the rooms are different but did not check, anyway, mine was good, althoug the view from the window was to the next building, about 5 m from the window ;( There is a restaurant downstairs that seemed to be good 'cause it was crowded both evenings. I went to the tapas restaurant on the same street (recommend by TripAdvisor 2011) to have lunch and also tapas in the evening. I can also recommend that one, very nice restaurant with good food and resonable prices. I think it was called Tapas de Tapas or something. They have a Tripadvisor logo on the door so it is easy to find;) Lunch with a soop, paella and a glas of wine was about 10 \\u20ac!\",\n",

There is no minibar but a fridge with as much mineral water with and without gas as you want and it is free of charge. The price is very decent for Barcelona, reason why the hotel is always fully booked and you should send your request early enough. I go often to Barcelona and this is my favorite 3*Hotel.',\n",

I would have preferred a bathtub and a real king sized bed (vs 2 doubles put together) instead of the loft area, which we never used. It probably would have been great for a family with children. You could tell the room was due for some minor renovation. Not that anything was broken, but the the floors could have been fixed up and and bathroom upgraded. The best part was our suite was in the center of the building, so it was very quiet. The street is very loud at night, so I couldn't imagine having spent the night in a street facing room. Overall, it was a very comfortable stay.\",\n",

Pros: - Location. It's near a metro stop, so it's easy to arrive and depart. It's also very easy to get to other attractions through the metro stop, or by walking. At the same time, it's just out of the main party areas so there isn't much noise the whole night keeping you awake. - Service. The management was easy to deal with before arrival, and during our stay. They helped plan the best departure time to get to the airport, and recommended some fantastic restaurants (instead of being recommended whoever has left a flyer at the hotel). - Comfort. I'm not too picky with hotel rooms, so I'll just say that it was clean, comfortable, and everything worked that I needed (not sure about TV/Internet, etc). There was also an unlimited supply of bottled water for anyone to use, which is extremely helpful for a summer holiday in Barca. I wish more hotels did this! Cons: None really. It's only that the price matches the quality you get, and it's hard to book in the high season (we tried again this year without success).\",\n",

The regular room had 2 beds and the bath...the suite had a king downstairs, a loft with a single upstairs..bath is upstair. There was also a mini fridge and armoir downstairs. The service was awesome. Food in their restaurant wasn't 5 star but it was good!!! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!! (We were here in October 2009)\",\n",

The room was a good size, groovy and not so noisy even though facing the street (4or 5th floor mind you). Again, v. low lights in the room and bathroom so get your torch ready if you are into precision make-up ! Nice touch free bottled water con y sin gas on each floor. The restaurant downstairs seemed very nice but the choice outside was too appealling to resist. All and all still great value for money.',\n",

However, if you do not take a suite, the rooms are quite small and dark. It was hard getting around in the room, since they had put in too much furniture. I did not understand why, but I could never use the Internet on my computer (too thick walls?). An advantage is the mineral water you get for free, but on the other hand, it is quite cheap in Spain. The breakfast was quite authentic with nice varieties of ham and cheese. But unfortunately, it was quite dark in the restaurant, so you did not have the impression that it was broad daylight... The staff could be more attentive. We went back in the evening to get our suitcases to take the boat to Palma and left the hotel about 10 PM. My partner had not discovered that he had forgot his wallet in the room by that time, but I think that someone in the reception could have set up a sign saying that they had found a wallet in one of the roomes. Now, the wallet is sent to us to a cost of 35 euros...',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"The Hotel Banys Oriental has a few really good things going for it. It's in the centre of the El Born district, in walking distance to everywhere. And its rooms are larger than average European hotel rooms (though from what I've seen on TripAdvisor they would still be smaller than American travellers might expect.) Our bed was comfy, the room spotless and the bathroom big and well appointed. Unbelievably good value for Barcelona. Our one warning is regarding bookings. We booked over the phone, only to arrive and find our booking had been made a year into the future! We still got a room and later, while chatting with a French couple over dinner in the restaurant downstairs, they told us they stay there every year and always book their room a year out to make sure they get one, so it was not such a surprise that the hotel thought we wanted a 2012 booking. The staff helped as they could and booked us a hotel for the night they couldn't accommodate us (a more expensive place, but they negotiated it so we could pay their room rate.) As a plus, the hotel's restaurant specialises in Catalonian food and our food there was excellent - we actually ate there twice, which is very unusual for us.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'We stayed at Banys Orientals for 3 nights in May. We stayed in room 203. It was a smaller room, but our bathroom was great. Huge shower, great water pressure, and a separate toilet room. The air conditioning worked, but only if the floor to ceiling windows were closed - so eco aware! There was a safe and a large wardrobe for hanging. The only problem was that due to the location of our room, we only got wifi in the bathroom. The staff could not have been nicer and more helpful. The last day of our stay our flight was cancelled and the staff at reception booked us back into the hotel, helped us call our airline and insurance company (at least 5 different international numbers), and they did it while not making us feel like we were a burden. And when we arrived before our room was ready we were told we would change in the bathrooms, use the free internet, and take advantage of the free water. They also stored our bags securely before we checked in and after we checked out. The location was perfect. So so easy to get to from the airport if you are taking the aerobus and right in the middle of the Old City. The Juame 1 metro station was 100 meters from the hotel, 5 minute walk from The Picasso Museum and Santa Maria del Mar was 2 blocks away. There was great nightlife in our area, locals and tourists alike wandering around the streets and having tapas and drinks. Only 10-15minutes walk to La Rambla, 20 minute walk to beach, 5 minute walk to Port Vell, and only a 5 minute walk to the Hop on/off bus tour stop. Banys also provides free water in refrigerators on each floor. We took huge advantage of this - would have paid a fortune for water otherwise! It was such a nice bonus! We could not recommend Banys Orientals more. A great place to explore Barcelona from.',\n",

The bed was large and comfortable. the bathroom was adequate with an excellent shower, although a little dark. Complementary toiletries were provided, as well as bottled water (from the fridge on the first floor) and free access to internet via a couple of desktop PCs in the public areas. Location was pretty much perfect for us, - just 50m from the metro and about 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas, the Cathedral and other sights. Plenty of local bars, restaurants and Tapas. There was some noise in the morning from external construction work but this was outside the control of the hotel. We ate once in the attached restaurant which was good value for money. Overall the hotel offers good value for money and deserving of its rating on Tripadvisor. We would be happy to stay there again if we return to Barcelona.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Our family of three has experienced various types of rooms in Europe but the Hotel Banys Orientals suite was remarkably spacious. The suites are located fifty feet or so from the hotel entrance so we almost felt as though we had an apartment with all the amenities of a hotel. Our daughter had her own small loft just above our bedroom It was also very conveniently located for most of the attractions of Barcelona either by walking or by using the nearby metro station. The amenities included easily accessed WiFi(slower speeds than we are used to but more than enough for browsing the web) and free bottles of water and fruit. Overall an experience we would repeat.',\n",

The downside to having such a great restaurant under the hotel is that there was pretty substantial noise all night--people talking, waitstaff yelling, bottles being thrown out, etc. Plus, someone got mugged in the alley behind the hotel. The amount of noise was impressive, but that's what you get in a city. The real problem was the mustiness of the bathroom. Although it was a good-looking bathroom, there was no ventilation, and subsequently there was mold, mildew, or a combination growing behind the walls or in places I couldn't see. But man, oh, man, could we smell it! After a few days of the exposure, I was unable to sleep due to a severe allergy flare up. As a positive, they give free bottled water to their guests.\",\n",

The suite we stayed in was roomy but poorly appointed, cold at night with only one blanket provided, the beds too hard, the WiFi never worked, it was noisy day and night and the bathroom was worn out and grimy. After we had checked out we realised that we had absent-mindedly left behind a couple of items of shopping in our room; although we were assured that these would be promptly shipped to us to the UK, they never were. After sending the management repeated emails asking what had happened to these items I only got any kind of response when I told them I was going to write them up on Trip Advisor if they didn't offer me some sort of explanation. Then all they did was strenuously assure me that they only had their guests best interests at heart, but they couldn't produce our shopping and they didn't make any attempt to make it right. A very low rent attitude from a low rent outfit indeed.\",\n",

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and the bonus of free bottled water and fruit on each floor was welcomed. We found it a great location to explore Barcelona. Walking distance to the port/beach area and also to the Ramblas. Overall a great place to stay in Barcelona. They were completely full when we stayed, as I'm sure they are most days, hence why they do not have the need for online booking. Very easy to book via email though.

       "   u'Content': u\"I stayed at the Banys Orientals w/ my wife and young children (ages btw 2 - 6) in August. We stayed in one of the Annex Suites in a building right next to the hotel. It was a very large room w/ two double beds downstairs and another bed in the loft upstairs. It was very roomy and clean w/ a large modern bathroom and was perfect for the whole family. Although we were in the Annex the room was immaculately maintained by the staff and we were only about 10 meters from the front desk. And for Barcelona it was a great deal at 130 Euros a night. Besides really liking the hotel itself, one of best aspects of it is the location in the heart of El Born neighborhood. Its on a nice quiet pedestrian street lined w/ great restaurants and a very short walk to the historic Santa Maria del Mar church. We ate at Taller de Tapas twice (our trip also included La Rioja, Asturias - where my wife is from and Segovia before flying out Madrid) and it was our favorite tapas place in all of Spain. We also had dinner at Senyor Parellada for classic filling Catalan cuisine, which was an amazing meal and amazingly cheap for the quality, portions and fine dining service. Besides the immediate neighborhood the hotel is basically a ten minute walk or less to the Catedral, La Rambla, La Boqueria Market, the waterfront / Aquarium and the Parque Ciutadella and Barcelona Zoo. Our children really loved all of these attractions (OK, maybe not the cathedral so much...) which made the hotel a great location for families. And besides that it was an easy few stop metro (located a 1/2 block from the hotel) to La Sagrada Familia, again making it very convenient for most of the main tourist attractions. Speaking of the metro though... while on it we were one of the many tourists in Barca who get pick pocketed and basically were targeted b/c of the kids. Although this was a very frustrating afternoon the front desk (and Camilla in particular) were EXCELLENT in helping us deal w/ our credit cards, get a police report and most importantly contacting the Motor Vehicle Dept in the US to receive a faxed abstract of my DL so I could still rent a car and continue on w/ our journey across Spain. They really went above and beyond what would be expected and for that I am still grateful. So although we loved the hotel anyway due to the Annex Suite and great location in El Born, it was the service provided during this stressful moment that both helped salvage our trip and prompted me to share my experience and strongly recommend their establishment. I hope you don't encounter what we did but if so rest assured that the hotel will go out of its way to help.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"This is a 3-star hotel that is just beautiful and located close to everything! I would definitely stay here again, and definitely recommend to others. I'm glad I booked in advance because once I arrived and checked-in, I found that they were completely booked. I was traveling solo, and booked a single room for the first two nights. The single room was small (the bathroom was almost as large as the sleeping area!). My third night I transferred to a double room which was really much more spacious, but of course a bit more expensive. There is internet and A/C in the room, it's very comfortable, and very quiet. There is also a restaurant on-site, but I did not try it. The location cannot be beat... it is right smack in the middle of everthing in the central part of downtown, maybe a 10-15 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya, 10 minutes to Las Ramblas, and a minute or two to all the wonderful tapas bars. The staff here is absolutely fantastic. I can't think of anything negative about this place - except it would be nice if the price were a bit lower but hey, this is Barcelona so you're going to pay a bit more.\",\n",

We were extremely disappointed as when we made a complaint to change rooms no feed back was given, we then requested to view the rooms in the real part of the hotel, they had at least a lift and the room shown is the one on the internet site not the ones we were put in. The location is very good though and near the barri gotic the port and not far from La Rambla no complaints re the location. If booking this hotel please request the rooms where the lift is located or if you can find another Hotel book that one.',\n",

The room was large with stairs leading to a kind of second floor. In some of the other rewiews people have made remarks about noise from the street, especially if the room faces l'argenteria street. There is a lot of pedestrians walking this street in the evening, and there is a lot of citysounds if the windows are open. This did not bother us at all, and when there was time for sleep the balcony doors where sufficiently soundisolated. The location is very good in the heart of the old town. 20min walk to the beach, 10min to the shoppingstreet, a lot of good restaurants just down the street. We recomend Taverna de Cobra, great tapas. Estruch right outside Barcelona Cathedral has great lunches. + free water each day i the refridgerator balcony - very low pressure in the shower no wireless network(but cable can be provided in the reception) breakfast should be included PS. visit Aire de Barcelona for a very nice spatreatment. The touristguides does not mention it but we recomend it. Be sure to book in good time!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Although I found this hotel as recommended by Conde Nast Travaler magazine in 2006, I would strongly advise not to stay there. I guess a lot has changed since 2006. Upon our arrival we were treated with great disprespect by the reception staff, they were trying to make us pay for one extra bed although the previous arrangments were made months before. Upon my notice that we had already agreed upon everything before, Mr. Juan Pablo at the reception explained that he has arrived at 3:00 PM that day and he does not care about my arranagments. In the meantime Mrs. Emelie from the reception was just smiling at our conversation and considered everything to be a good joke. There was no one on the duty responsible that evening, so we could not really speak to anybody else. The manager's name was declined to us. The best part happened when we tried to check out - there was an attempt to charge us double price presuming we had not paid1/2 for the hotel before. Again we needed to enter into discussions and prove our point. So, my advise is to avoid this hotel if you want a stay without arguing to the staff. Also about safety - the rooms can be accessed throught the balconies from the street. The sign on the balcony's door says - please close when out of room and while sleeping for your own safety. One day when we came back to the room after being away for the whole day, the balcony's door was wide open since the cleaner had opened it and forgotten to close it.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"On our recent honeymoon to Spain, Barcelona was our first stop. We wanted a reasonably priced, well situated, safe place to stay to help us discover all the city's charms, and Hotel Banys Orientals could not have been a better choice! The location is great. There are hip shops and restaurants right outside the door, but the side street on which the Hotel is located does not create a lot of street noise. You are incredibly close to a Metro Stop and also within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and many other attractions including a short walk to the beach! One of our favorite things to do was to walk outside and get lost in the charming streets of the Gothic neigborhood. Unlike the more hectic sections of the city, we never felt unsafe in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. The staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations and any questions that we had. The fridge full of free water (both with and without gas) and the free internet were also nice bonuses! Although on the smaller side, our corner room was not as small as some of the rooms we had seen in Spain and it also allowed us privacy. It was clean and comfortable. We enthusiastically recommend both the city of Barcelona and this hotel as a base within its charms. Buen viaje!\",\n",

After a bus ride from the airport you arrive at the hotel which lies in a small side street where no cars can go. The reception is tiny yet entering the building towards the back the true beauty unfolds. A classic restaurant with balconies above your head. A mellow lighting complements the entire look perfectly. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. Plenty of space for suitcases and clothes. The bathroom is also very nice and I was positively surprised about the little welcome present.

It is very good value for the money - clean, lovely architecture and very stylish decorated - Very nice bathroom and very comfortable beds. Complimentary waters and apples added to the great stay. What you see on ther wep page is really what you get. Some has written that the rooms are a bit small - I don't know what they compare to, being in the middle of an european city and being a 3 star hotel I found the room normal size, not small at all. I've heard it can be noice from the street - I am not surprised, there are lots of businesses and restaurants on the street. We requested a quiet room and had the best sleep in a long time. We didnt have a balcony but that was fine for us. Breakfast is more than great. Here as well you really get your money worth. We only had breakfast once though - there are som many caf\\xe9s and restaurnants in the neighbourhood that need to be discoverd. = ) Only bad thing is that the breakfast room was a bit dark. We paid around 100 euro a night and I consider that a very resonable price for this lovely hotel. I will be back = )\",\n",

After reading other comments about noise etc. I emailed the hotel and asked for a room on the top floor away from any obvious sources of noise. I was not disappointed. The walls are not the thickest but apart from the occasional sound of conversation next door we were not troubled. The beds were comfortable and we slept really well. We did have long, busy days though. We decided to take breakfast in the hotel and there was always plenty of choice with staff refilling empty dishes efficiently. We were set for the day after eating. The staff at reception were very friendly with welcoming 'Holas' every time we passed through reception. They quickly answered our questions and phoned several of the churches to supply us with a very comprehensive list of mass times. They also gave us some good shopping tips. The location is very central with many nice bars, restaurants and shops close by. I would certainly think about booking this hotel if I was to return to Barcelona in the future\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We stayed in this hotel in Barcelona for 4 nights in April 2010. Firstly, the location is simply brilliant, right in the heart of El Born and the Old City. The building is beautiful, the staff are wonderful and the food in the attached restaurant was delicious and authentic. I recommend the Oxtail, and the Anchovies with bread. Great olives served up in paper cones and divine wines. The restaurant looks and feels like a Michelin starred restaurant. OK, so here come the cons. Noise. We were staying in one of the suites which are located in a building further down the street. Our room overlooked the street. Firstly, it was very noisy, Argentera is a main pedestrian thoroughfare and our first night (a Saturday) was spent awake until 6am when the church bells rang out. There was loud singing and shouting from revellers, it sounded like a carnival out there! The hotel cannot be held responsible for this but it would be sensible to insulate the windows better. Light. The buildings are old, in those days they built buildings in Spain to be tall and close together to create some shelter from the fierce midday sun...as a result, the buildings are designed to be dark but the management need to provide better lighting, the lighting in the rooms from table lamps to reading lights etc was all wrong and generally not bright enough. We wanted to open the curtains fully to let in as much natural daylight as possible but couldn't because of the office building across the way and people looking in. It really did feel like a dark cave in there. Internet Access. There is wifi internet in the building but the base station emitting the signal is too far away from the suites we stayed in and we therefore couldn't get online. This was actually a fairly major thing for me as I needed to keep in touch with work stuff in case deadlines were missed and not being able to check emails from the room was a pain. Some simple and inexpensive changes would turn a good hotel into a great hotel. How difficult would it be to change the lightbulbs to be a brighter wattage, put a new router near the suites to increase the signal for internet and put in some double glazing? We would definitely go again but we would choose a room in the main hotel, higher up to get the maximum natural daylight. We cannot fault the staff who always greeted us a with a smile and a Hola and who helped as much as they could.\",\n",

There were extra toiletries stocked in the room and even a pair of slippers; however, there was no clock and no refrigerator. Free WiFi in the rooms was slow, but functional. Breakfast provided a good variety of foods. The location of the hotel is excellent, with easy walking to public transportation, the Cathedral of Barcelona, many restaurants and shops. I would have rated this hotel more highly but the noise at night was a problem. I was often awakened around midnight by \"dumpster\" noises of emptying trash, breaking bottles, and slamming metal, as well as by loud talking of workers from a nearby restaurant. This lasted for at least an hour. The sound insulation of the rooms was not effective, either. I could hear my neighbour talking loudly at 2 a.m. and hallway traffic (with closing doors) was disturbing. So, if you are a very sound sleeper, or if you can get a room away from the alley and restaurant, this may be a good choice of place to stay. It is not the place to stay if you need quiet at night. I would recommend with reservations.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"I stayed two nights at this hotel during the summer and was not disappointed. I booked a suite because there were no regular rooms available. The suite was next door and had a separate entrance. The space was immaculate; very clean, modern, loft-like with exposed gothic beams. Free water (still & sparkling), apples, internet and huge comfortable bed. The location is excellent. A 10 minute walk from many tourist areas including Las Ramblas, Barceloneta, Picasso Museum, etc. and right next to a parking lot and the metro. There are only a few negative things that I can think of. One is that there was no elevator so my heavy luggage had to be carried up and down the stairs. The second is that the hotel is somewhat hidden and is hard to find. I didn't try the food so I can't comment on that. Overall, a very cool boutique hotel with helpful employees. I visit Barcelona every year and I'll definitely stay there again next summer.\",\n",

My favorite detail about the room were the floor to ceiling french doors that opened for me to look out in to the alley. I had a second floor room above the kitchen to the restaurant connected to the hotel. I heard a few pots and pans clang together and trash bags being thrown out. That lasted until about 2 am and then it was quite. Next time, I will request a room on a higher floor. The hotel is very convenient to the trains-up the road a half block and then cross the street. I'll be going back in Feb. 2010, so I'll let you know how that goes.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"My wife and I booked a room for 2 nights just after Christmas after reading a great review in The Times of London Travel magazine. We were put in the handicapped room on the first floor. It was directly next to the kitchen staff doors. We were woken up at 1:30 in the morning with doors slamming and loud talking by the staff. This persisted and I went to the front desk to complain. Nothing could be done. Then the trash from the restaurant was being taken out at almost 2 in the morning directly under our room and outside the window. We could not sleep at all. We decided to leave the hotel in the middle of the night as this was insane. The front staff locked us in until I paid the bill for the night. We paid and went out find a hotel at 2 in the morning. This ruined our trip entirely. I have written to the hotel about this experience and no response 5 days later. Nothing. The worst thing is that this is where they put people who may have a handicap - that's terrible. We were able to pack our bags and leave, but not everybody can do that, especially in a wheelchair. Shame on them. This was the worst hotel experience anywhere in the world, ever. Do not give them your business.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We stayed in the suites for 4 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. It was great to have so much space and feel so at home - we felt we just had our own little flat in Barcelona. The suite was easily accessible and just a 2 minute walk from the main hotel and you could phone the hotel for any thing you needed. They cleaned our rooms each day and refilled our fridge with water, which was complimentary. They had wi-fi as well as computers for use. The location is perfect because you're not in the touristy hub-bub of Las Ramblas but only about 10-15 minute walk to it, if you want to see some of those sights. You're also just around the corner from one of the tourist bus stops, which was perfect for us to get oriented to the city. The staff was so helpful in getting our luggage in the room for us, they also assisted us in making reservations for dinner. The hotel is decorated in a very contemporary way and is lovely. They are also very close to the metro if you want to take it. The adorable cobblestone streets of El Born are lovely and filled with great restaurants, bars and shops. We also stayed in a regular room at the end of our trip (we took a 1 week cruise and stayed one night upon our return before flying home). The regular room was also nice but much smaller. I was glad we opted for more space for our longer stay, as we felt so at home and not cramped at all. We can't wait til our next trip to Barcelona and Banys.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"A lovely hotel in an excellent location. We found our room to be a good size, spotlessly clean and well equiped. The room was looking out on to the street which was lovely in the daytime and evening but be aware that refuse trucks do come down here at night so if you think this might bother you, definately request a back room. We had breakfast in the hotel on one morning which was a bit chaotic but the choice of foods available on the buffet was excellent. We'd also recommend Taller de tapas just up the street. We also tried the restaurant, Senyor Parellada, on one evening which was a bit of a disappointment. The staff seemed rushed off their feet and we were left for ages without even having a drinks order taken. When we eventually did get our food, my boyfriend's starter was not what he had ordered and despite telling two different memebers of staff, we gave up and just ate what we had been given and left. We really enjoyed Lonja de tapas (near the picasso museum) and would definately recommend that as an alternative. Overall, this hotel is a great find that offers good value for money in an absolutely fantastic city.\",\n",

Unfortunately, the wall to our room was paper thin and I had to bang on it in the night to stop our neighbour snoring. There is a good buffet breakfast but it tends to be a bit fraught with all the guests filling up. An alternative is the Taller de Tapas at no 51 which has a good breakfast menu (from 9am) and is a bit more relaxed. Newspapers from the vendor at the Metro entrance at the top of the street.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We stayed 3 nights in the hotel and 1 night in the suites because of booking issues (that we were told about in advance). Most of my comments are re the hotel. First, the bad. This hotel looks chic, but it was all done on the cheap and now it's showing its age. Nothing major, just a lot of little things that, taken together, made it seem shabby. The floors were fake wood and were buckling, giving a weird squishy uneven feeling when you walked around, the magnifying mirror (which you sort of had to use because it was lighted and the bathroom was so dark) had broken and was floppy so you had to hold it up to look in it, the sink plugs had broken off their chains and were just left that way, stuff like that. Also there was dust on the tables and lamps, the floor felt gritty, and the idea to paint the shower black wasn't a good one because the housekeepers are apparently unable to remove the white water grime. The room we had 3 nights faced a side street and didn't have much street noise when the windows were closed, but it was right by the elevator, which was quite loud. Also had a very ill-mannered American woman across the hall the first night who evidently had a spat with her boyfriend and was slamming doors and yelling for an extended period starting around 2:30 in the morning. Not exactly the hotel's fault, but I felt like it was sort of the kind of place that attracts the wrong clientele or something. The room was dark. There was no wifi available, even in the lobby, but there were two computers for guest use. I think there were DSL connections in the rooms, but we hadn't brought a laptop, just iphones. The good. Complimentary bottled water was a perk. The air conditioning worked well. Location was excellent, just a half block from the metro and right in the heart of great shopping and restaurants. I liked the neighborhood best of any we visited in Barcelona - a nice feel with little narrow streets, not much traffic, a very young crowd. Graffiti focused on political themes, which to my mind is best if there has to be graffiti. There was a little restaurant close by called Bubo that we ate at several times and liked a lot. Best coffee we found anywhere in Spain, for one thing, and the desserts were fantastic. The suite: not technically a suite, but much larger, quieter, and it was nice not to have to exchange fake smiles with the hotel desk staff, who were not exactly friendly. The suites are a few blocks away from the hotel, and we never saw another soul in the building while we were there. I might have felt a little uncomfortable if I had been alone, especially with the sign telling you not to sleep or leave the room with the window open. But as it was, it was sort of nice. The suite had the same decor, but didn't have the same shabby feel our room in the hotel did.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Despite the pathetic value of the British pound against the Euro, this hotel still offers excellent value for money in a fantastic location. Rooms are spotlessly clean and whilst not huge are extremely comfortable, with a small balcony overlooking the street below. Free still and sparkling water and fruit is provided on each floor which is a really nice gesture, where other hotels would put it in your room and then charge an extortionate price for it. Didn\\'t bother trying the breakfast which is a reasonable 10 euros since the hotel is surrounded by plenty of places to grap a drink, quick snack or a meal. Great sandwiches which are big enough for two are avaiable at the nearby \"La Colmena\" pastisseria, for 3 euros. The location is one of the best things about this hotel, being close to all the major sights and transport links without ever feeling too touristy. There are loads of really cool drinking bars, restaurants, shops, cafes, ice cream shops and tapas bars all around this area, many hidden in quiet narrow side streets which you can spend hours exploring. Pintxos must be the best invention ever..! The area is fairly busy but I didn\\'t notice the noise, although in fairness we were out quite late ourselves.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'We stayed in Banys for two nights, just to spend the Weekend in Barcelona and found it very nice and comfortable. I lived for one year in Barcelona and know the city centre very well. Bany Orientals is located perfectly in the heart of the G\\xf3tico Area and you really find everything near to you (even Metro and Bus). The value you get for the money you pay is above average for Barcelona. Even for bad Hostals I paid only 20 EUR less, compared to Banys Orientals, if you like the Hostal rooms with own bathroom. The Hotel has a very nice abstract and cosy style, the breakfast is very good and the service as well. If you get a room to the street it is of corse not very silent, but this is the charme of the mediteranean City of Barcelona. Some small things of course are nice to see, but not very good to use. The lightning of the bathroom indeed should be improved (especially at the sink and mirror), but this wasn\\xb4t really a problem. I felt very good \"at home\" in the Banys Orientals rooms. Especially our room had two levels. Entering you could go directly in the bathroom/WC. Going some steps down (wooden steps in the material of the floor, very nice!) there was a hugh bed that was of a good quality. A small balcony to look, what is going on on the street, a big window with good curtains (no light enters at morning!) a small table with nice lamps on it, pictures on the wall - all those things made it overall a nice space to stay. Not very big, but to relax after walks through Barcelona. I will go to BO again. Definitely.',\n",

We arrived at the hotel very late on the 23rd, there were 6 of us, so 2 taxis from the airport to the hotel cost 32 euros each. Check in was really easy and we were greeted by our names which was a nice touch (and very easy I am guessing by process of elimination of guest arrivals). We were given rooms 101, 102 and 403. 101/102 were two twin rooms and 403 was a double bed. On each floor was a fridge containing still & sparkling water, and also fruit on the 4th. A couple of nights, we requested an iron/ironing board - which were brought to the room in less than 5 mins each time. There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom and two amentity kits should you need them... toothbrush, comb.. sponge etc. Everyone (all the staff) was really friendly and polite..... and actually really helpful. The size of the rooms were ok, i wouldnt say large but i have stayed in a lot smaller, say in Paris. So very happy and i would most definitely stay there again and highly recommend. The Bus Turistic stops literally 2 mins from the hotel - near the beach - near everything really.\",\n",

The rooms aren't very spacious, but you find everything you need (all the standards like TV, safe, ...) with one exception: there is no mini bar in the room. Instead you have a big fridge on every store where you find mineral water (still & sparkling) for free(!!!), as well as a basket with fruits. The service is very nice and helpful. In the basement of the hotel is a very famous restaurant, but there are so many others around, and tapas and wine bars, ... that I still haven't been there. Don't forget to have a look at Santa Maria del Mar, the church is not even a 5 min walk away and on a Saturday you may be sure to see a real Spanish wedding. What I like best is the situation of the hotel and the quietness inside although being in the middle this throbbing atmosphere of Barcelona. What I like least: the bathrooms begin to age a bit\",\n",

Tube is 2 min walk away, lots of bars and reataurants on your doorstep, other main attractions such as Placa Rei, Ramblas, Gotic all less than 12 min walk away. Free internet, water and air con. Found the staff helpful when organising transport back to the airport. It is very noisy so ask for an interior room if you think that will be a problem and if you like a tea or coffee first thing in the morning take a travel kettle as one is not provided. (Great takeaway coffee shop towards the church at the bottom of the road, not open until 10.) Would definitely go back.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Hotel Banys Orientals, in Barcelona's Bourne district is a great deal. For 99 euros our room was reasonably large, very modern and immaculately clean. Two high speed internet terminals were available 24 hours a day. The location was great, with lots of people coming and going, numerous tapas bars and retaurants on the narrow street right outside the hotel's front door. The hotel restaurant, open to thre public was quite popular for dinner although we did not eat there, enjoying the tapas bars instead. If you would like to start the day with a solid meal the hotel's optional extra cost buffet breakfast (10 euros) is worthwhile.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We stayed in Banys for five days in May and I can't reccomend this hotel enough. The location is fantastic and I think for the price the hotel was outstanding. We requested a quiet room so I can't comment on the noise but it is down a busy pedestrianised street so I can imagine a room at the front of the hotel would be noisy. The room we had was small but perfectly adequate for our needs, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom well equipped. The staff were generally not that friendly but they were helpful when we asked for anything. We didn't find the restaurant at the hotel to be that great. Cal Pep near by is great for lunch or informal dinner and if you want somewhere special but expensive the restaurant Noti is amazing. Another special place for dinner is Somorrostro in Barceloneta, a real find down a small street you wouldn't usually come across, the food is exceptional.\",\n",

This fantastic hotel is located just off of a main street in one of the best parts of Barcelona. It is surrounded by great restaurants and a quick walk to many tourist attractions and the stops on the hop-on-hop-off bus tours. The rooms were on the smaller side, but very comfortable and very clean. We asked for a front facing room and enjoyed the birds-eye view of the street and the breeze at night. The staff were friendly and helpful; check in and check out were a breeze. I researched tons of hotels in Barcelona before booking this one, and for the cost (we paid $97.50E per night), there was not a better hotel than this one! I highly recommend this hotel!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"My husband and I intended to stay in this hotel for 5 nights. We booked the suite to be able to spend some nice comfortable time during our stay. The hotel for us was a complete disappointment: - The suite is far from the main hotel. - Very loud, even with all windows closed, we could still hear every little noise from the street. (not even mentioning the loud motorbikes and constructions) - The lighting is poor. (very dark and not practicable) - TV is small, very far away from the bed and only provides local stations. Besides the facts above, the bathroom was the main problem for me. The water got cold after 10 min shower. The shower cabin is half open, so a lot of water ended up outside, from this not only the wooden frame of the cabin has suffered and went bad, but also it appears that from earlier showers the wooden floor of the suite itself has suffered. We reported this problem to the front desk at the first afternoon we arrived. They confirmed to check. The other morning we informed them again, they said it was already fixed. BUT again, the same thing happened, I stood in shower with cold water. We asked for solution or another room, which was not possible as the hotel was fully booked. At the moment we were already exhausted of discussion, we said we'd like to check out. During packing for leaving, they called us again and said they would like to send a professional technician to fix it and also would offer us some discount while staying here. Nevertheless, they did not confirm a specific discount and the attitude of one staff on the phone was incredibly unfriendly and impatient so we finally decided to leave. While doing check-out at the front desk, the unfriendly staff did not apology but insisted on being right and told us hotel rooms with problems were normal. Also he kept complaining about us in Spanish. My husband was very unpleased and we had to waste one full day with discussion, checking out, finding a new hotel and being angry with a bad choice we made. Anyway the bedroom of the suite was big, with a comfortable bed. The hotel offers Free internet ( but slow and no wi-fi), free water and three free apples. Some of the staffs were very supportive and helpful with the problems, but a bad unprofessional staff made this hotel the worst place we've stayed so far.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We have just returned from a very pleasant trip to Barcelona, city of Gaudi. The three of us agree with the positive reviews about this hotel. We were very happy here: the rooms are very nice indeed, location cannot be better, hotel amenities excellent, including the free water and apples at each floor, excellent european breakfast buffet, cleanliness, reception staff very helpfull and friendly. The location in the Barri Gotic is excellent: the major sights are all within easy walking distance: Barceloneta, Modernista buildings on the Passeig de Gracia, the Rambla, Palau de la Musica. For the Sagrada Familia church you need to get a subway train or bus. The subway station is right next door. Very handy. The Born district of Barcelona has many tapas bars and restaurants and many (upmarket) boutiques. Overall a nice and safe place to stay. However, if you are planning to wake up later than 7.30 in the morning this is probably not the place for you. Every morning around this time construction work starts in neighboring buildings. Likewise: if you sleep light, be advised: from 11 till 2 at night empty wine bottles are thrown by the bucket load into dumpsters. It is fair to say this goes with the territory, as this is a district with bars and restaurants open till late at night. It did not bother us that much: we stayed from sunday night till thursday, only sunday night was very noisy. We always get up early, so we were not bothered with all the construction work going on. As to the tapas bars in the same street as the hotel: we liked the Tapas bar La taberna del Cobre a lot: good food, nice, efficient service and a very reasonable price. We were very unhappy with the Taller de Tapas bar (also on the same street as the hotel) : when we were getting ready to order our food and drinks, we wanted to order three glasses of wine. The waiter tried to talk us into buying a bottle which was not what we wanted, and a lot more expensive than the price in neighboring bars and tapas restaurants. He was very obnoxious and insisted that a bottle would be our best buy. His cheapest offer was 4,80 euro per glass. As we prepared to leave, he suddenly discovered the housewine that was 2,80 per glass. By now however, we were angry and so put off by this obvious attempt at ripping us off, that we got up and left - and went next door, to the Cobre tapas bar for the second time, where we were given a free drink after our dinner! We don't know what the quality of the food at the Taller is, but we DO KNOW that we don't like to be treated like this. This restaurant was always very busy, so probably the food is okay, but its probably wise to be alert and don't be railroaded into ordering things you really don't need or want. We had great food and wine in all tapas bars in the area. Barcelona is a great city to visit and the Banys is without doubt excellent value for money.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Staying in Barcelona was not for sight seeing or vacation on this occasion. I chose a suite as I wanted additional space for luggage etc and to be able to sit and relax whilst sorting out my forthcoming travel plans etc. The suites turned out to be located in an apartment building down a narrow alley distanced some way from the main hotel. There were some homeless people and stray dogs around and I did not feel very safe walking at night back to the room. The suite itself was over-looked by opposite apartments which meant one had to keep the curtains drawn all of the time. The sitting area (an uncomforatble settee/bed) of the bedroom was divorced from viewing the TV and had very poor lighting. If you understand Spainish then you will OK to watch TV. The hotel receptionist said that the TV\\'s in the suites could not have the language changed on the TV set. In fact the reception on the TV was pretty poor anyway - I guess it was due to the alley way location. To view the TV required one to sit on the bed as there were no armchairs - only one upright chair at the desk location. Free internet access in the room was an appealing asset of the hotel advertised facilities Yet at the desk area there was no telephone point so it was necessary to sit on the bed where the telephone point was located under the bedside table. So it was not comfortable to work at ones\\' laptop siting on the bed. Three of the lights were not working in the room and had to be replaced. So in other words housekeeping had not really checked out the room. Whilst there was free water in the refrigerator, two of the botles had been opened and partially used! Another housekeeping failure. As the room was away from the hotel it would have been nice if coffee making facilites had been included in this room price. We used the dining rooom in the evening and whilst it seemingly has a good reputation, the meal was not exceptional as we had hoped. The femail receptionists on the arrival afternoon were very friendly and helpful as they could be which could not be said of their male counterparts the following morning. No smiles greeted you and they behaved as they were doing you a favour. I politley reminded the hotel of some of the inadequacies of the room and things that still needed to be addressed before there were new room occupants. I also suggested that it would be helpful to have an actual clock in the room. The receptionist pointed to my wristwatch and asked why I could not use that instead. I guess he thought it would be fine to sit up in the night and turn on the dim (low voltage) provided light bulb to see what the time was; remember there was inadequate lighting in the room and due to being over-looked no natural daylight either. So an illuminated clock would be of distinct help to any future user. So I guess if I am being asked what did I think of the hotel ,,, then I would say \"Disappointed\". I certainly would not recommend using a suite until you have checked that all of the above have been considered and dealt with by the owners.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We stayed in the hotel for a family wedding taking place nearby and it was ideal because of the location. Located centrally in the centre everything is on hand. The area El Born district is really nice with lots of lovely tapas bars within a stones throw away. Very close to the marina and beach too. Nearby is a cafe / bistro called Milkat 21 Gignas (www.milkbarcelona.com) which is great for brunch If you come out of the hotel and turn left I'd recommend the tapas bars there (eaten in them several times) and a bit further up take a right and there is a bar called La Luna which is a good place to visit. I would make one note of warning, this is a touristy area and late at night the atmosphere changes (after the tapas bars shut)-don't go walking around on your own as there are a lot of unfriendly characters about. Also beware of carrying too many valuables with you. We enjoyed sitting out in the tapas bars on the friday night around midnight but the next evening we were still out post wedding at 1 / 2 am ish and it was quite a different story The hotel The staff were all really friendly and helpful during our stay and couldn't have done more for us. The rooms were nice but very modern. This was fine for us but if you don't like chic modern this isn't the place for you. The suits are of a generous size and located in a building a couple of doors down (something to be aware of if you have children). Our room was very spacious but some of the other family members rooms were not as big. The beds are the same size in all the rooms (very large about 6ft) which is great but the size of the bathroom varies and not all have baths. However this wasn't a problem for us as we didn't want to spend much time in the room. If your room doesn't have a fridge then there are some located in the hallways with free still and sparkling water which is really handy and a nice touch. I've been to Barcelona several times and would highly recommend it as a city to visit. Its easy to get around, there is lots to do and see and its a vibrant place. Agua on the beach front, near the Port Olympia, by Hotel Arts is a lovely restaurant (booking recommended). In a nutshell Excellent value, I'd stay again. Nicely designed hotel in the Born district, in the old town. Get\\u2019s booked up quickly\",\n",

The desk staff is not knowledgeable about the city, beyond sending you to the sightseeing bus and directing you towards La Rambla. Everything else is as though they lived elsewhere. It's very true that the hotel is centrally located and that is by far the best thing one can say about it. The room we had was small with only a small kitchen type chair to sit on if you used the other one chair to open your luggage on. This is totally forgivable in my mind but my wife has a back issue and found the room very uncomfortable. The worst and most grevious offense was that we had a 6:30 AM flight and wanted a taxi for 5:00 Am so we requested a wake-up call for 4:15 AM The desk called at 5:00 when the cab driver got there and reminded them he was to carry us to the airport. It was a miracle we made it or our connections, hotel and plans for the rest of our trip would have been spoiled, not to mention we would have had to stay in Banys another night when they were admittedly completely booked.

The Hotel Banys Oriental fulfilled all our needs, ticking all the boxes and more!! We were allocated one of the suites in the annexed building. We had reservations about being based away from the main hotel at first but these were unfounded. We were delighted with our chic, well-designed spacious suite with a balcony overlooking the pedestrianised street below us, and a mezzanine with comfy sofa. The decor was modern yet understated and elements of the original Gothic architecture had been retained which made this a unique hotel experience. I think what made our stay in the Hotel Banys so good was the fact that we were made to feel like we were being looked-after which was in stark contrast to our stay at the Hostal Fontanella just a short distance away (see my review under the title Control Freaks!). ALL the staff were SUPER helpful and friendly and were more than willing to make our stay the best it could possibly be. We thought the cost of the suite at 135euros was great value for the standard of decor and service we received. The added extras of free water in the fridge, a bowl of fruit and free internet access were just some of the details that made our stay in the Hotel Banys a memorable one. I've been telling all my friends about this gem of a boutique hotel!! GO THERE!!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'We stayed here at the recommendation of friends. For the price, you definitely cannot beat it, especially given that you are right in the middle of El Born, but it really is not all that (contrary to the glossy recommendation in the Phaidon Wallpaper Guide). The staff wasn\\'t all that friendly - it was almost as if they were doing us a favor by answering our questions or helping us out - and the accomdations are just really basic. I just have a problem with two twin beds being put together and having it be called a double. Also, the black-tiled bathrooms had some sort of paper on them for \"effect\" and that was peeling on the shower floor - not exactly the most hygenic, to be honest. Worst of all, there was this blaring construction going on right outside of our window, which made siesta and sleeping in a bit of a challenge. If you just want a place to sleep, dump your stuff and shower this place is suitable, but if you want to pace yourself I would find another place to stay.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We were three friends that stayed in one of the suites. Starting off... the location was very nice. Five minutes from the harbour with great restaurants and sights, ten minutes from Ramblas and a couple of blocks from the Jaume I metro station. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We tried the breakfast one morning and it was a good buff\\xe9 with lots to chose from, though I was missing a real good cafe con leche. We didn't try the restaurant for dinner, so I can't comment on that. As I said, we stayed in one of the suites. Ours was located in another building about 150 meters away. It was very spacious and stylishly decorated. Fruit and water were provided free of charge... love that! If things like room service and on hand staff are important to you, then the suites might not be what you want. But we are quite independent travellers and liked being on our own exploring the city using the room only for sleeping. And the price can't be beaten... 130 euros(+ 40 for extra bed) per night! I have been to Barcelona several times and had seen all of the major sights... so this time I did a day trip to the Montserrat monastery. It was wonderful... I highly recommend the trip!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'The Banys Oriental is in the (old town) Ribera district of Barcelona and is very handy for the Picasso Museum and the other museums that occupy that street. It is also easy walking distance from the Ramblas. The hotel is not huge and is a refurbished old building decorated in a cool, calm and modern style with a confident touch. The room we had was a double and was adequately-sized but maybe just a touch on the cramped side to get round due to the large size of the beds. There is one small elevator serving all guest on all floors, so sometimes it can take a while to reach you. Nice touches were the big glass refrigerators on every floor, stocked with (free) chilled bottles of water, alongside big bowls of fruit. The attached restaurant is very good indeed and is popular and has a good reputation with non-guests as well. The big attraction of this hotel for me was the location on a traffic-free street in the heart of Ribera which meant that most places we wanted to go were within walking distance, Also, everything worked and it was calm, comfortable and stress-free. Would I go again? ... yes, very probably.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We've just got back from the Banys Orientals, having booked following reviews we had read on this site. We booked direct by e-mail, and they were very efficient and answered questions promptly in English. We felt that the room price was excellent value. We caught the bus to Barcelona from Girona Airport with no trouble, and because it was very hot when we arrived at the bus station we decided against carrying luggage up and down stairs on the metro and caught a taxi instead - 15 minutes in heavy traffic, \\u20ac8, not bad, and a friendly lady driver who dropped us off at the corner. We travelled around the city by metro on one day, using a ten journey ticket between the two of us, and found it easy, and the rest of the time we walked slowly because of the heat, and with a prolonged lunch somewhere, and a siesta back at the cool hotel that worked fine. Our second floor room was very stylish, especially the bathroom, but it was quite tight to get around the bed, and there was a huge wardrobe but no drawer space or hooks to keep things tidy. However, who cares, for three days? The wardrobe safe, air conditioning and free iced water and internet were all very much appreciated, and the bed was wonderful. We looked out at the back of the hotel on to a quiet area. The staff in reception were unfailingly helpful and courteous, those in the restaurant were less smiley, but did the necessary. We were using both English and Spanish and felt that their knowledge of both might have been less confident than the reception staff. We ate one dinner and all our breakfasts in the hotel, and they were all delicious and very good value, especially the breakfasts if you can eat lots from a buffet in the morning, easy to fill up and then you don't need much later. If you don't want to eat much for breakfast, it's probably cheaper to go elsewhere, like right next door to the hotel. We also had some lovely lunches and dinners in the bars and restaurants round the city, and can recommend the Taller de Tapas and the Taberna del Cobre in the same street as the hotel. We didn't know Barcelona, and three days was a good introduction, one for the historic central part, one for the port and beach area, and one for the Gaud\\xed trail. Try the chocolate museum not far from the hotel! With ordinary city street awareness and common sense about what to carry when and where, we felt quite safe everywhere at all times. We shall go back for the rest of the sights at a slightly cooler time of year!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"We were recommended this hotel by a friend and booked through the hotel directly. The hotel is in an ideal location and within walking distance of the beach and La Rambla and Placa Catalanya where we caught the Bus Touristic. The welcome pack in the bathroom of the hotel is a nice touch, as are the complimentary bottles of water on each floor which you can help yourself to each day. It is a little noisy and the bathroom is like a sauna however these 2 negatives are totally outweighed by the location, clean and comfortable rooms which are well decorated and furnished, complimentary water, welcome pack, free internet access and directly above a superb restaurant (Senyor Parellada). The Santa Maria church and square are a stone's throw from the hotel. The square has a good wine bar called La Vinya del Senyor where you can sit outside in the square and watch the world go by with a glass or bottle of whatever your heart desires from a huge wine list. There are small restaurants and a bar (Buba) next door which are all worth a visit. If you walk round from the square in the direction of the zoo you'll find a boulevard which comes alive after 11pm with local bars - well worth a visit if you like to keep away from the tourist bars. Avoid the acclaimed restaurant called Los Caracoles - we had a terrible meal there which was very expensive. The paella was inedible and the bread rolls were stale. It was such a disappointment after having queued for a table. On a different night we also queued for La Fonda which is just a long the street from Los Caracoles. The meal was excellent and really good value for money - well worth queuing for. Sightseeing Tips: Casa Batllo is well worth a visit if you like to do something different indoors. Avoid the Vasquez part of the Picasso Museum as it is mind numbinging rubbish. Make a visit to Park Guell as a stop on the Bus Touristic route. Don't pay to enter the Sagrada Familia. The inside of the beautiful cathedral is literally a building site with nothing to see other than a queue of people waiting 90 minutes to get the lift to the top of one of the spires. The outside is breathtaking. The view from Park Guell is free and is just as lovely. The boating lake in the park next to the zoo is a good place to sit and soak up the sun.\",\n",

Granted the bed was enormous, but I found that rather charming. The hotel was very clean and modern and the service was great. I didn't quite like the black! shower, but I guess that's just a matter of taste. We had a room overlooking a quiet side street and we had no trouble with traffic or noise. Guests had free access to two computers on the second floor and there was complimentary water bottles for guests on every floor, very nice in the heat of July. The location of this hotel is superb. A short walk from La Ramblas, one metro stop from Barceloneta(the metro station right outside the hotel) and a number of charming botiques on every corner. But my number one selling argument would be the price. 99 euros a night. Trust me, that's a reasonable price for a hotel like this.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Banys is a good choice for so many things--location, price, cleanliness, etc. The rooms are spare but stylish and comfortable. Another nice touch is that they supply free bottled water and fruit. There is no need to pay extra for the breakfast. There are cafes on either side of the hotel where you can get a good breakfast for a fraction of the price. We were a party of seven, with four rooms. After one night we decided to switch rooms--my aunt and uncle were going to move into our room and my husband and I were moving to a different room. This was okayed by the front desk. Someone told us the room number we\\'d be moving to and that we could move our luggage there. It was still being cleaned, but the maid let us bring the luggage in. My aunt and uncle brought their luggage to our old room. While my husband was down the street somewhere, I was waiting in the hall for the room to be ready, which was just supposed to take a couple more minutes. Then I heard angry footsteps approaching from the elevator. It was another guy from the front desk who was in a fury because we had already put our luggage in the room. He yelled at me in Spanish and broken English (including the word \"stupido\") and then stormed off to shout at my aunt, who was waiting in the lobby. He was angry because we had moved our luggage into the rooms before they were ready. My husband, who is fluent in Spanish, talked to him afterward and told him he had overreacted and that he shouldn\\'t have yelled at us, that we had been told we could move the luggage. He gave my husband a grudging, ungracious apology. A couple of days later my uncle observed him yelling at another hotel guest in the lobby. We all wondered why this person chose a career in the customer service industry.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Banys Orientals was a chic, clean, and perfectly situated. A great value for a very good hotel. Hotel: Clean, simple and chic, nice little LCD tv in the room, great balcony views of the street action. The staff was friendly, the art in the room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the air conditioning unit in the room was fairly good but might be a concern if it would have been hot. Bathroom was nice enough, but didn't have very good water pressure in the shower to really make showering very enjoyable. We thought it was a good balance of modern and comfortable. Location: Right on Calle Argenteria which runs right through the La Ribera district (also known as the Born district). There was a lot of action right in front of and around the hotel. At the same time, it wasn't very noisy at all. The Born district is so full of life, and art/fashion is what this area is about. Plus some great restaurants, pastelerias, and shops within a few steps of the hotel. Additional Benefits: Free water bottles in the mini refrigerator on each floor. Two computers with free internet access.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"This is a nice small hotel with one of the best locations in Barcelona. You can literally throw a ball from the hotel and hit the metro station and the Borne area is very nice and full of lively bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The service is very simple. Do not expect much. I would suggest bringing earplugs because the walls are thin and it's very noisy outside. The hotel is often full and hard to book but it's worth trying because the price is excellent. The restaurant next store called Senyor Parrellada is really good...fresh, good tasting, resonably priced food in a nice atmoshphere...can't ask for more in a restaurant!\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Stayed here May 24-26th, and i cant believe how inexpensive it is compared to everything else around. It is about a 5 minute walk to the Barcelona Cathedral, Picasso Musuem, or Las Ramblas. So its right in the middle of everything, The hotel lobby is on a fairly busy street/walkway with lots of shops and vendors everywhere. We stayed in a suite which is not conected to the lobby. It is about a 2 minute walk down the street next to Santa Maria Del Mar Cathedral. The suites are in an apartment bulding and the only bad thing is that there is no door man. I felt safe walking home at 3am, but i could see that some people might not. as it is down an alley a few steps The good thing about the suites, is that they are not on the main walkway, so they are pretty quit. The suites were huge with 2 rooms and a good size bathroom. The rooms came with a fridge and free water and fruit. They had no english TV stations however. The rooms had hardware floors and you are provided slippers, and the rooms are decorated very nice and simple. If this hotel made the lobby a little fancier, and maybe put a doorman at the suite building, it could easily charge 2x as much which is what all teh other hotels in the area charge.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"This is a beautiful hotel located on a great little street in the center of Barcelona. If you enjoy convenience and value for money with a touch of design, this is the hotel for you! I won't repeat what the previous reviewer said about all the amenities (all true), but I will comment about the noise level. The hotel was EXTREMELY noisy, both from within the hotel and from the outside street. Sources of noise from within the hotel: the wooden floors, the lift (strangely loud) and the hotel's decision to start working on the plumbing at 8am. Sources of noise from outside the hotel: street cleaning trucks, revelers and drunks, and the single windows unfortunately did not guard us whatsoever. Honestly, i cannot understand anyone NOT being disturbed by the noise. Over breakfast we chatted with other guests who experienced the exact same thing even though their room was on the other side of the hotel. Oh, speaking of breakfast, SKIP IT. The selection looked old and unfresh. There are many options just outside the hotel and much more delicious. In conclusion, I would stay here again, but this time I'm going to bring ear plugs. Hopefully that will solve the problem.\",\n",

The room is not v big but we love what is provided. We have unlimited supply of water (still as well as sparkling) at a fridge by the lift, 2 computer terminals with free internet access, amenty kit with comb, hairbrush, sanitary napkin, a bathing sponge, shampoo, bath gel and body lotion. There is also a manifying mirror in the toilet. There are english channels like CNN and BBC which is good for the non-spanish speaking like us. The restaurant which belongs to the hotel serves fantastic food! Before arriving at the hotel, i was quite worried after reading so much comments about the noise. while it is true that the el born area is bustling at night, our room was really quiet as it does not face the street. So if u want some peace and quiet, request for one with the hotel. Only thing i don't like so much is that the toilet is a little dark at night with only the ambient lighting illuminating the toilet. We love the place and will definitely recommend it to out friends.\",\n",

We loved the neighbourhood which was very lively and full of bars and restaurants! Now about the hotel itself... - We've stayed in a room (not suite) in the 4th floor and it was very small indeed! Also we have asked for a quiet room so they gave us one on the side street which was..'adequately' quiet!! (sometimes you could still hear some noise though but not a big deal...) - The bathroom was lovely but the power of the shower was not very good. - They have refrigerators with free bottles of water on every floor which was very nice. - They have two computers that you can use for free, or if you have your own laptop they give you a cable and you have free internet in the room! (big plus for us!) Overall our feeling of the hotel is really positive! I would definitely recommend it to friends because it's in the most amazing location (for me the best), nice decor and even though the rooms are small, but i think it is a great value for money hotel in Barcelona (100\\u20ac/night),\",\n",

Rooms were fairly large, bright and clean. Bathroom was large and well equipped but did lack any kind of ventilation so took a while for steam to clear after a shower. All guests can have free bottled water and fruit which are placed on the landings. Hotel location quite central so not far to restaurants. Easy to get to from airport via bus and a 15 mins walk, you can get a metro to the end of the street if you don't like the walk. If arriving late would suggest taxi as tourists seem to get targeted by pickpockets. Recommendations for where to eat would be Les Quinze Nits in Placa Reial, you have to queue but food is good and fairly cheap. For the best ice cream I have ever had there is Gelaaati on C/Llibreteria next to Jaume I metro station.\",\n",

Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned. Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street. Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room. The hotel (and cleaner) were no doubt banking (correctly) that we wouldn't bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station!\",\n",

Our room was 3rd floor above the alley outside the restaurant kitchen so after the kitchen noise finally died down, the motorbikes started up. This is a common thing in Barcelona, becuase of the late nights and small alleys, unless you can find a hotel w/ dual glazed / modern windows.

A five hour flight delay meant that we eventually arrived at the hotel at 3am. This is where it began to go well. We were greeted by a very welcoming young man, who booked us all in with great charm and a warm welcome for such a late hour. The rooms are individually designed to fit the space available in an oldish building. This said they are very smart, with all the features that you could wish. Not large, but big enough for a stay of our length. The shower in our room was spectacular! Breakfast is an extra but well worth it. A huge array of cold meats, boiled eggs, spanish omelette, cereals and enough pastries to keep you going all day. The attached restaurant serves Catalan food to a high standard but you will need to book - we got in our our last night. If we go back to Barcelona, and I do hope we will, we will definitely stay at the Banys Oriental.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"This hotel was recommended to me- and i can not recommend it more highly to you! It is an amazing city, and this is an absolute gem of a hotel- we actually stayed at the adjoining apartments. Only \\u20ac125 per night!! Gorgeous, clean, complimentary fruit/water in your own fridge!! Small mezzanine floor with small sofa/ bed- just cool for a chill out! Two small balconys- only enough room to stand out on- with amazing, if a bit restricted, views. Bed is two twins alongside, encased in a four poster frame. Very comfy- didn't mind the twins at all. BAthrooms were kitted out better than some 5 stars I've stayed in! Complimentary everything. We lost our lauggage, and the hotel even supplied a toothbrush- and they didn't know- it is a complimentary service, And a great touch. Absolutely central, and absolutely chic. Gorgeous Tapas Bar downstairs- reasonable and friendly. Fav roaming places were Gothis quarter and the Plaza Real- just around the corner- towards Las Ramblas. There's a wee street at the top of L'Argentaria, if you turn right and walk 200 metres (if even) there's a lovely little supermarket for water or wine!! I had emailed the staff in advance, and always got a prompt and friendly reply, no matter what the request. Absolute pleasure to stay here- could only be bettered if they were to introduce pool/ sauna etc... Go- and you will love it!\",\n",

It may not be the place for travelers who like a lot of peace and quite but if you're looking to enjoy the city and be in walking distance of most things, then it's the place for you! We booked several suites along with doubles. The locations of the suites are a good little ways from the main facility but were safe and comfortable. We'll return here again and encourage others to do the same. It's a great deal for the $$$$$. The staff was helpful.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"The Banys Oriental Hotel was, for central Barcelona, very reasonably priced. For this price range, I thought the hotel was wonderful. The location is great - within walking distance of the Cathedral, the Santa Maria del Mar, the harbor, the Ramblas, and great shopping. Metro and bus are also close by. I would note that the street noise can be a bit loud at night (particularly since locals keep later hours than the average Brit, American or German). This did not bother me at all, but I can see that if you were a light sleeper, you might find the level of activity at 1 a.m. to be bothersome. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant next door had good food and I would recommend making a reservation for dinner there. The breakfast was expensive (10 Euro per day), but the variety of items was excellent. We only had breakfast in the hotel twice and of course, it was a European breakfast ( a lot of different rolls, breads, croissants), cheeses, meats, cereals, soft boiled eggs, and fruit. There were a lot of options and the quality was good. If you just want coffee and a croissant or a panini, I would recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and heading out to a local cafe (considerably less expensive). The hotel also has computers that you can use on the second floor to check your e-mail or surf the Web. This is free of charge and I found it to be a nice service in terms of checking in with home. The rooms themselves are very nice ...contemporary design and very clean. The hotel provides slippers, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, a hairbrush, comb, sponge, toothbrush, showercap, etc. to guests. This was a nice perk. For this class of hotel, I really only expected soap and perhaps shampoo, so I was pleasantly surprised at all the other toiletries. The bathroom was also nice, if small. The only thing that I really didn't like about the room was that the bathroom had no ventilation...fan or otherwise. As a result, there was always a lingering mildew smell in the bathroom. Finally, the hotel provided a refrigerator full of bottled water, available to guests on the floor. I thought this was a very nice amenity, given that restaurants and shops will charge you 1 or 2 Euros for the same bottle of water. In short, if you want to be in the center of the action and you want good value for your money, this hotel comes highly recommended.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'Having never been to Barcelona before, I have no basis of comparison to other properties in Barcelona. That said, the location was perfect. In the heart of EVERYTHING, and we could be just about anywhere we wanted within a short 5-10 minute walk. To have that kind of central location without all of the crazy noise, was a plus. The hotel was reasonably priced. The rooms were really not well designed. They had nice furniture, linens and such, but they were not well laid-out. For example, we were in a King-Bed room. The Four-Poster Bed took up over 95% of the room. We literally spent our time negotiaing the 1 meter perimeter of the room AROUND the bed. The closet was unacceptably small and there was no chest of drawers so we were living out of our suitcases. Also, there was no room for the suitcases, so we piled them up around the bed, making it even harder to move around. The bathroom was nice and clean, but there was no ventilation and it had a musty smell. Frankly, for a \"boutique\" hotel in Europe, I was hoping for something a bit more elegant and with the basics- room to put our suitcases, hang up clothes, and a room which could be navigated without having to step over and around (or side-step) the furniture. Very disappointing experience.',\n",

Having never been to Barcelona before, we found it to be perfectly located for many of the main 'attractions' which meant other than a taxi to Parc Guell we walked everywhere. We stayed in a lovely suite, which when booking we were given the impression were around the corner, are actually about 3 mins walk away on a quiet non commercial street, in a building shared with other apartments/suites. Having said that it meant it was extrodinarily quiet for mid city and we felt a little more independent. It was cleaned daily though, including fresh towels & linen, and was very spacious, fab slate tiled bathroom! The buffet breakfast was great, but a bit pricey at 10 euors a head when there is a fab little pastry shop 3 doors up from the main hotel where you can both eat for 7! There are also some wonderful tapas bars on your doorstep, not to mention ice cream shops!!\",\n",

Really glad we were as its a really really nice hotel particularly when compared to the other hotels we had seen, for the same price!! They had sold out of the normal rooms so we went for Suites.They were really good in size and you could tell that the whole hotel had pretty much been newly renovated. Really nice modern quality mixed with a bit of character. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. Free water in the fridge. Brilliantly located Hotel. Close to everything.

We were expecting a slightly small room, from previous reviews and this is the case, but to be fair, at 98 Euros per night, you can live with it! The bathroom, whilst stylish was in need of some renovation, with quite significant water damage around the bath - again, you get what you pay for. We loved Barcelona and in particular this area and would definitely return - so many great bars and restaurants, right on your doorstep and all very reasonable. We stayed for 4 nights and would gladly have stayed for longer - you need the time to visit all the amazing sites and architecture. We flew to Girona, where we stayed for 2 nights, then got the train to Barcelona. On our return we got the Bus from Barcelona back to Girona Airport - all incredibly easy and convenient and cheap. A nice touch at the hotel is free mineral water on each of the floors, together with free internet access - quite a plus when considering how reasonable the room rates are. On the downside, there is some street noise outside, mainly commercial bin/bottle collections, although this was only bad on one night.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I had checked various websites including \"tripadvisor\" before booking this hotel for a long weekend with my wife and another couple. However closer to our departure I got a bit nervous as some of the reviews were not favourable but I decided to stick with our original (and very cheap) booking. I need not have worried. The location (in El Born) is fantastic with so many shops, restaurants and cafes nearby in little sidestreets and squares. The hotel reception is little more than a desk and anyone who wants a grand lobby, bar or even a great buzz from the hotel will be disappointed. However all of these things are provided by the area in spades so the lack of facilities were made up by the rooms. We had booked suites which were a few hundred yards away off the Placa Santa Maria which again had plenty of life both day and night. The rooms were very spacious and well-kept. The decor was modern and minimal without being sparse. They are like small apartments with a shared communal entrance but at @ \\xa390 per night they were a bargain. I would have no hesutation staying there again and although some reviews said staff could be surly they booked a restaurant and taxis for us with no difficulty and were very courteous. If you spend a lot of time around your hotel go somewhere else but if you enjoy a little bit of luxury at a knockdown price book it now.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"It's a nice and modern hotel. We stayed for four nights. We stayed in the suites which is in a separate building about 5 minutes away from the main location. It gives you a feeling of having your own apartment in Barcelona. Our suite was huge and very classy, cool, and modern. It's surrounded by tine old streets and so you can hear whatever goes on. We stayed on the first floor. This is the metalsmithing area so you can hear some of that. Also, when people talk in the streets, you may be able to hear it. The room was beautiful and airy. TV only had Spanish local channels. Bathroom had a huge shower, but some of the fixtures were coming out of the wall (soap dish).\",\n",

Cool, stylish design, a nice view from our 2nd story window to the pedestrian alley below with the Christmas market. Located very close to the old quarter of Barcelona, the hotel is walking distance from so many attractions - we walked down to the harbor, into the old city, all over the place! Breakfast at the hotel did cost extra, but was worth it overall - lots of choices. The free water in the fridge in the hallway was absolutely delicious and a refreshing surprise! Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much and would absolutely stay here again.',\n",

We also ate at their restuarant next door, which was the worst meal we had during our entire 8 days in Spain. By the end of our stay, my boyfriend and I had determined that Banys Orientals is badly managed, and while staff blend in with the sex appeal and design sense of the hotel, they lack the warmth and hospitality most of us seek when travelling abroad and exploring a new city.

Placing the reservation may need a little patience. But once you're set, you'll be set. Location of the hotel is top. It's located in the center of the most hip area of Barcelona. Surrounded by great tapas bars, hip stores (not the standard shops you find in every city), main attractions are in walking distance, metro station is only a second's walk from the hotel. Breakfast is extensive and very good. The rooms are big enough to enjoy your stay. Bathrooms are large (in comparison to other city hotels in Europe). Amenities are great. Internet cxn incl.

       "   u'Content': u\"Frankly, if you're sat there reading this review you're wasting time that could be much better spent booking this great little hotel. We had a 2 night stay in one of the suites (all the normal rooms were gone). The booking service was good, and email confirmation was sent within minutes. On arrival, our bags were carried up to the suite by a very nice bloke and we were left alone in a beautifully cool and spacious room, complete with mezzanine, enormous bed, fridge stacked with complimentary water and balcony overlooking some of Barcelona's best bits. The windows shut tight to block out all but the noisiest of party-ers while blackout curtains ensure an undisturbed night's sleep, meaning your stay is as peaceful and relaxing as it is comfortable. What's so amazing about this place, however, are the prices. Our suite was 125 Euros (about \\xa390) per night for two people, which was amazing considering what you get, and the standard rooms are much cheaper. We'll be back again, and reserve a little earlier to make sure we get in. Seriously, stop reading and book it.\",\n",

The hotel itself is clean, attractive and is highly recommended by us. We did not eat there as there are so many good restaurants round about. The food market in Las Ramblas has an abundance of fresh fruits etc so this was a good place to sit and eat breakfast amongst the locals.

       "   u'Content': u\"Having booked Banys on the recommendation of a colleague we were a bit concerned having read some of the less than positive reviews on this site, however we can only say we had a fabulous time here with no problems at all. We had booked one of the suites and on arrival the receptionist carried my wife's case to our room which was less than a minute away from the main hotel. The suites are entered through two iron security gates and up a a staircase. We were quite happy that these gates were in place as the road that the Hotel is located on is very busy with pedestrians and having left quite a lot of electrical equipment in the room the extra security gives additional peace of mind. We stayed in suite A1 and it was very similar to the photos shown on the website. We did find that the suite was quite dark although we did think that this was in keeping with the style of the room and there were numerous lamps and spotlights to brighten things up. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a fridge in the room stocked with still and sparkling water and any used bottles are replaced free of charge each day. On the mezzanine level there was a large couch and a lamp which was perfect for relaxing and applying sun tan lotion ! The bathroom was quite small containing a shower and toilet with the sink being located outside.We certainly did not have any problems with a lack of hot water as had been reported by a previous reviewer. The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic, being set in the vibrant El Born distict of the gothic quarter. There are numerous shops, bars and restaurants nearby, but we especially liked Les Quinze Nits located about a 10 minute walk away in Placa Reial. The menu is quite simple but everything we tried was absolutely delicious - so much so that we ate there 5 times ! It is also unbelivable value for money - 3 course meal for two with a bottle of wine and coffees was about 40 Euros ! The restaurant is really popular with queues starting about 30 minutes before opening time - we estimated that there must have been about 100 people in front of us one night, but having been seated, the service was fantastic. Another favorite and highly recomended place is La Vinya del Senyor located in Placa de Santa Maria which as would be expected only serves wines. The staff were extremely knowledgable and helpful and as a lover of dessert wines we discovered the ultimate in Castano Dulce which was absolutely amazing. All in all this was one of the most enjoyable holidays my wife and I have had in a long time and based on our experiences would recommend Banys Orientals and Barcelona to everybody, it is unbeatable for value and second to none for location.\",\n",

We stayed in one of the suites which were located in another building a couple of minutes walk away.The entrance/lobby to this building was drab and dark with a tiny lift serving the suites. The staircase was like a fire escape and the layout complicated. It was very unwelcoming. The suite was a decent size and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom looked good but using the facilities was tricky. The shower leaked all over the floor and the glass door leading to the toilet was heavy and difficult to open. We ate breakfast in the hotel on the first morning which was dreadful. The buffet selection was poor and there were cleaning products left by the cleaner stacked in a corner smelling of bleach. The Taller de Tapas on the same street serves an excellent breakfast so we ate there instead. Overall the hotel was reasonable value for money but we would not return.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I have very mixed feelings about Hotel Banys Orientals. Pros: Forget the Ramblas, the hotel is in the best part of Barcelona, El Born. More restaurants, wine bars and medieval ambience than one could shake a leg of ham at. The adjoining restaurant was one of our favorites (we eat there twice). The free water was nice and often needed. Cool suites with modern look and the price was right. Cons: The sleek modern look was better viewed from the Internet than in person. For example, instead of removing the old decor, i.e., sinks, cabinets, etc. the hotel simply installed false walls to cover it up; a bit strange. This leads to the biggest con, because of limited space do to the false walls, they only installed a 10-gallon hot water heater. It lasted exactly 9 minutes; we timed it, and took 4 hours to reheat. We either showered together (very small shower) or, one at night and one in the mourning. The suite had a large two-story window that looked out at the staircase, not much of a view. Noise wasn\\u2019t much of an issue but in the busy season I could see how it would be. The staff is young and not very helpful or knowledgeable. Things to be aware of: There are two different suite buildings, one building is right next to the main hotel and the other is 300 yards away, down a small dark alley. After complaining about the limited hot water, the hotel offered to move us to one of the suites down the street, which has newer hot water systems. We got an uneasy feeling about the location and declined. So uneasy, in fact, we would rather take 4-minute shows than stay there. As for the standard rooms located in the main building, they seemed fine but small. However, be aware many rooms and even entire floors were unfinished. Guests had to climb over paint cans and other debris to get to there rooms. Like my title, I have mixed feelings, it\\u2019s not a hotel for everyone, certainly not travels how require attentive staff and hassle free rooms. If this hotel was located anywhere else I would give it 1 star but location, location, location\\u2026',\n",

Nice large walk in shower. Free chilled bottled water was a godsend with a huge fridge on each landing full of the stuff. Located in the heart of the bario gothic near the cathedral. Very central for sightseeing. Liked it so much went back again in Sept. 2005 with partner. Good value hotel.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Just returned from Hotel Banys Orientals after a 2 night stay for my hen weekend. We stayed in the suites which are about 5 minutes from the main hotel, they are fantastic! We booked 3 suites for 8 of us, all 3 suites were slightly different but all equally as nice. The main bedroom was huge with a big 4-poster style bed with 2 single matresses, there was also a tv, desk and fridge in the room. We also had a room with a single bed and then the bathroom which was very modern (the best power shower I've ever had!). We had 3 patio doors which led out onto a long balcony so you could see the goings on in the street. The rooms were very clean, I defnately have no complaints about this hotel and will hopefully be returning very soon. The location is excellent with lots of bar and cafe's nearby, also just 5 mins taxi away from la ramblas. Would highly recommend this hotel to anybody.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"My friends and I just returned from the Banys Oriental. We stayed there from Feb. 19 - 22nd. First off, the location is unbelievably great. You're walking distance to almost everything. I can't comment on Breakfast, since we did not pay for that as we planned to have coffee and whatever in a local cafe daily. and there are MANY local cafe's to grab a bite at. The best coffee is at a franchise near the hotel called Cappachino. Anyway, we asked for two adjoining rooms and unfortunately, they did not have two next door to each other the day we arrived. But the hotel did arrange for us to be together (next door to one another) from the second day until we left. They even moved my friends luggage. The rooms are basically clean and simple. Much better than a motel 6 and you certainly cannot expect the Ritz Carlton for the price you're paying at Banys. WE had a fantastically comfortable bed, roomy bathrooms and yes, there is definitely a musty smell but it did not bother us. We had a great view of the street below and it was NOT noisy as other areas. For 95Euros, you're getting a steal. The best bargain though, is the Banys restaurant right next door. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation. The place always has a line to get in......the food is out of this world. Enjoy your trip if you're headed out to this wonderful little world. saytheword (NYC)\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'We stayed in Banys for two nights, just to spend the Weekend in Barcelona and found it very nice and comfortable. I lived for one year in Barcelona and know the city centre very well. Bany Orientals is located perfectly in the heart of the G\\xf3tico Area and you really find everything near to you (even Metro and Bus). The value you get for the money you pay is above average for Barcelona. Even for bad Hostals I paid only 20 EUR less, compared to Banys Orientals, if you like the Hostal rooms with own bathroom. The Hotel has a very nice abstract and cosy style, the breakfast is very good and the service as well. If you get a room to the street it is of corse not very silent, but this is the charme of the mediteranean City of Barcelona. Some small things of course are nice to see, but not very good to use. The lightning of the bathroom indeed should be improved (especially at the sink and mirror), but this wasn\\xb4t really a problem. I felt very good \"at home\" in the Banys Orientals rooms. Especially our room had two levels. Entering you could go directly in the bathroom/WC. Going some steps down (wooden steps in the material of the floor, very nice!) there was a hugh bed that was of a good quality. A small balcony to look, what is going on on the street, a big window with good curtains (no light enters at morning!) a small table with nice lamps on it, pictures on the wall - all those things made it overall a nice space to stay. Not very big, but to relax after walks through Barcelona. I will go to BO again. Definitely.',\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Bany's Orientals is an absolutely beautiful hotel! It's designed and decorated with a kind of stylish simplicity that I associate with the West's take on the East (particularly Japan). I stayed for business, so I was thrilled that it was not just an identical box business hotel. The location was excellent, as well. The included breakfast was great, including items sure to please Spaniards, Brits, and Americans alike, plus it was served until fairly late so it was very convenient. The bed was comfortable, with clean soft linens. Unfortunately, all the goodness was packed into the superficial level, leaving a lot to be desired. There was no internet service available in the hotel, the heating/cooling unit was so high tech that it was impossible to program, and there was no overhead light so even with every lamp turned on and the curtains open, it was difficult to see. The bathroom is also beautifully useless. The sink design makes one very apt to spray themselves or the room, the shower design makes that absolutely certain, and the lack of ventilation left me with a thin film of condensation on every surface when I finished.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"After staying in the Casa Camper before moving to Banys Orientals, we were not overly excited to be checking in. But we knew that there is a reason why Banys charges E100 and Camper E200! When we arrived, we were informed that the hotel does not know about our booking! Fortunately I had a printout of an email confirmation, which, upon presentation, quickly sorted out the confusion. We actually hoped that they did not have any rooms, so that we had a reason to go back to the Camper (which in reality we could not afford for another night!) In the end, we got one of the streetfacing rooms on the first floor, which was nice and spacious. Pros: - Nice design, although the monochrome colours seemed a bit dull after the bright reds of the Camper. - Free water good since Barcelona's tastes awful. - Although the hotel does not have wi-fi, I was given an ethernet cable to connect to the port in the room. This worked perfectly. - Nice bathroom, although some of the tiles in the shower need to be replaced. Strange double taps? Cons - Soundproofing. The problem bothered us at first, but we got used to it. One can hear people talking on the street even with all the windows closed. Occasionaly we could hear conversations and tv in the room next door. The problem is manageable and not quite as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be. All in all, at about E100 for a double, Banys Orientals is a sobre choice if one of your prerequisites is nice design. I have done a lot of research on boutique hotels in Barcelona in this pricerange, and this still seems to be the best choice.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"Yes, the bathrooms smell - though I think it's less due to lack of cleanliness and more due to a lack of ventilation - and yes there's a bit of noise from the uncarpeted hallways and streets outside, but the location is unparalleled, and the price is unbeatable. While you don't get amenities like room service or laundry, you do get a very helpful staff and all the bottled water you can drink. And, for not too much more money, the suites are huge with nicer bathrooms - though they are in buildings separate from the main hotel. I'll go back for a 4th trip. The only thing I'd change would be giving out a set of earplugs with each room - we brought our own and it makes all the differnce in the world.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u\"My husband and I went to Spain for our honeymoon and stayed in one of the suites at the Hotel Banys Oriental for six nights. The suites are not in the same building as the hotel, which we knew. However, when we entered the building where the suites were located, it was literally like entering a prison. We passed through a metal gate door which you have to slam shut for it to lock. Then we walked up two flights of stairs into a cement courtyard (we called it the dungeon) to get to our room. There was a loud refrigerator there holding the bottled water. There were no plants, very little lighting (which seemed dangerous since the door was hardly ever closed and locked), no chairs or table -- just a dark, windy, and a liitle scary area to pass through before entering your room. Fortunately we were on the first level. Other guests had to climb an enormous metal staircase with their luggage to get to their rooms -- there is no elevator. There are also no employees in the suite building. The room did look like the pictures we have seen online, but some things have to be noted in person. The floors which appear to be hardwood, are in fact, vinyl - made to look like wood. This would have been okay (albeit a little cheesy) except that they were filthy and bumpy. The lighting in the room, the bathroom, and the loft space was so poor that it was quite depressing. There is no overhead lighting - only one floor lamp (which we moved down from the loft because we literally couldn't see) and 2 table lamps, all with low wattage bulbs. The bed frame was a made out of a cheap wood painted black -- ikea-esque, but worse, with screws sticking out on the bottom. There were 2 strange clip lights on the bed frame that were like car headlights. As it was November, and getting cold, we could understand the room being a bit cold, but our room was unbearably cold. We turned the temperature up as high as it could go, and it was still too chilly to stay in there any longer than we had to. The loft space was boiling hot, and the downstairs was icy. Not to mention that the room was so dark and dreary that we wanted to be anywhere else. We tried to change hotels, but were unable to find anything. We called to tell them about the lighting situation and the freezing temp, and they said that it would be warmer and brighter in the morning with the light streaming through the windows. That never happened, even on a bright sunny day. It was dark, cold and depressing for the duration of our stay. When we say dark, I mean, we could not see our clothes in the suitcase! We asked to change rooms, but nothing was available. The bathroom was more of the same -- dark and cold -- very unpleasant. The boiler broke in our room the day before we left and we had no hot water. They said that it could not be fixed until the following day when we were checking out anyway. We were also unsure of the cleanliness of everything. For the six days that we were there, the sink area was never cleaned -- made us wonder what else was never cleaned. We know that they did not change the sheets on the bed either. The breakfast, although plentiful was a bit disappointing. It seemed as though not everything was so fresh -- some stale bread, cheese that sat out for too long. But overall we were able to eat well enough to start our day. We did not have any English channels on our tv which would have been nice to have during siesta time. There were a few upsides -- the price, location, and the free bottled water. We would not recommend this hotel for more than 2 nights. We also suggest staying in the main hotel instead of the suites. Our overall opinion was that on the surface everything looks good, but underneath there was not much quality.\",\n",

       "   u'Content': u'I stayed at this hotel for three week day nights in early November. E90 per night. I was by myself but had a double room (which I had booked because a single was not available). The room was on the second floor (105) at the back and was very quiet. I know that others have complained about the thin walls and noise from outside but I heard nothing. Excellent cold breakfast buffet for E9.60 - cereals, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheese, juice, coffee etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke English. There was a safe in the room (enter a 4 digit combination). Room was all black and white decorations and was very clean. Very nice having free cold bottled water available. The location was excellent - steps from the Jaume subway station and the Cathedral. I would certainly stay there again. andrew',\n",

The walls, and doors could have used a bit of attention with a fresh coat of paint and the furniture was a bit scuffed  The bed was hard and the mattress had seen better days  The small \"toilet room\" smelled as if it had not been cleaned from the previous guest  Hotel hallways were dark as well  As other reviews have mentioned, rooms in the front of the hotel can get loud but nothing that a pair of earplugs can\\'t take care of  Overall, this hotel did not meet our expectations so we left after one night to find accommodations more suited to our liking Banys Orientals has rooms in two locations (close-by) in central Barcelona  The suites were spacious with nice dark wooden floors and minimalistic decorations  Much bigger than average hotel room, but facilities were limited and rooms were not equipped according to luxyry standard - good and comfortable but not luxury  There is a good restaurant next to the small lobby  Much of the action and sights are close-by, very good location Stayed 3 nights for our honeymoon and would happily stay there again  Nice welcome on arrival by friendly staff  Very clean hotel, and the room was something special    Very nicely furnished and a great comfortable feel to it  Located close enough to some major sights, we still managed to walk just about everywhere (but Barcelona is a big city so be warned that fitness and comfortable shoes are needed if you plan to walk)  A very nice restaurant within the hotel, if not a little expensive but it was a 5* restaurant  9/10 for food, quality, taste, presentation and service  Very close to some great off the beaten path restaurants I stayed at this hotel last weekend  The staff were extremely helpful, making restaurant bookings, giving directions and advice etc  The rooms are small and a bit sombre, so I wouldn\\'t recommend it for a romantic break I just needed somehwere clean and central to sleep and it served its purpose  It is indeed a great location, at the start of El Born, near the metro station (Jaume), buses and a taxi stance  If you are a keen walker you can walk practically everywhere (beach, main shopping areas and sites in city centre) from there  I did not try the breakfast, or the restauarant, which I\\'ve heard is rather good The rooms at the back are apparently quieter but smaller and darker  The shower is big and the hotel provides a trousse of toiletries  Also welcome is the free mineral water and fruit in the corridors to which guests can help themselves  The only improvement I would make is tea/coffee making facilities since there is no room service for breakfast  Some of us need a cuppa before we get dressed!We liked this hotel, although it offered no amenities, other than unlimited free bottled water and fresh apples in a bowl in the hallway  There is no lobby to speak of, but the room is a good size, the bed comfortable and free wi-fi  The location could not be better; the hotel is convenient to everything a tourist would want to do in Barcelona  Not all of the staff at the front desk spoke English, but they did try to be helpful  There is no full length mirror anywhere in the room, and the wooden floors in the hallways certainly carried the noise of anyone walking there at night  There is a well respected restaurant in the hotel, but apparently not really affiliated with it, which we thought was only fair and not up to its reputation  Our room had a double glass door opening onto a tiny balcony looking into an alleyway, which made our room rather dark  The furniture was modern just as the hotel photos show  All in all, we would recommend this hotel primarily for its terrific location Really liked this hotel - location was great, staff very welcoming and helpful and the rooms etc were lovely and old style  The fridges of complimentary water on each floor is an excellent idea  Would highly recommend this hotel  Lots of lovely bars, restaurants and shops close-by Just flew back from Barcelona where we had a fantastic time staying at this hotel  Well decorated, smart, with a good-sized room, well-stocked bathroom (huge shower) and free bottled water and fruit on every floor  The service was excellent, very polite helpful staff and the hotel is situated in the perfect location - especially if you like good quality food and drink, which we did  The breakfast, for just 10 Euros is well worth enjoying, especially if you have a busy day planned  Would recommend to everyone The hotel is in a great location with some cool bars, shops & cafes on the door step  There is a Metro stop really close by and there are so good places to go running along the beaches or in a park that are both close to the hotel  The staff are friendly and efficient and the building is typically Spanish with stylish rooms In among the narrow streets of Barcelona\\'s old town, and nestled next to many of the best restaurants and bars in the city, this hotel is a gem  You get to stay in an historic building that\\'s hundreds of years old, yet it\\'s tastefully done and very modern in its facilities  It feels safe there too (good locks, and every room has a safe) which is important in crime-ridden Barcelona  Great staff, a good breakfast (chargeable), and a high quality restaurant onsite too  Don\\'t expect to park anywhere near, and you have to walk to a main road to get any transit or a taxi  There is WiFi but it\\'s poor (as would be expected with those dense buildings and thick walls)  However overall it\\'s top quality accommodation I had a couple of nights in the hotel in Feb  The rooms are big and clean, location is very good and the staff is friendly  Pricelevel is also good, about 80 \\xe2\\x82\\xac/night  I guess the person/company who booked the room for me had some extra price for it     I hear that all the rooms are different but did not check, anyway, mine was good, althoug the view from the window was to the next building, about 5 m from the window ;( There is a restaurant downstairs that seemed to be good \\'cause it was crowded both evenings  I went to the tapas restaurant on the same street (recommend by TripAdvisor 2011) to have lunch and also tapas in the evening  I can also recommend that one, very nice restaurant with good food and resonable prices  I think it was called Tapas de Tapas or something  They have a Tripadvisor logo on the door so it is easy to find;) Lunch with a soop, paella and a glas of wine was about 10 \\xe2\\x82\\xac!Perfect location and very nice hotel  Breakfast is fine but the restaurant for dinner downstairs you can\\'t miss  There is a fridge in every floor with free bottles of water for guest, which is great  The neighboorhood is awesome, filled with tapa bars and restaurants  I would definitelly stay there again beautiful clean hotel with a charming and friendly staff  We thought the location was hard to beat - close to beaches, ramblas, and shopping  Great dining abounds!Good location (Born) just some meters from metro station Jaume and only 15 minutes walk to Portal del Angel (shopping street) 20 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya and 10 minutes walk to the port  El Born is full of little Tapas places, Bars and good Restaurants as well as little, beautiful and unique shops  I like this area a lot though you must be careful of pickpockets  But nowadays they are everywhere and in every city     The Hotel is small but very nice, the rooms are ok in size, nice deco and bathroom is modern  Everything is quite new and modern and very clean  There is no minibar but a fridge with as much mineral water with and without gas as you want and it is free of charge  The price is very decent for Barcelona, reason why the hotel is always fully booked and you should send your request early enough  I go often to Barcelona and this is my favorite 3*Hotel This verry noise place and 3 floor rooms are dark, you dont know when is a day and night you will hear from outseid verry loud music and sound of peoples are shouting but the rooms are verry clean  keeped verry clean at the end you will feel you are living in bunker,and they have a internet but it dosent work,not possible they have two hotel house and boh of them same noise and dark The unfriendly sevice by the recepcionthe rooms are verry expensive if you want have good sleep and quite then better get 5 floor rooms otherweis you will not able to handle with noise dont ask them taxi to airport,it will cost also more money  Be care full If you are in the metro in L4 gracia, they trayed to steal my pocket ! and also james1 ! if you traveling to barcelona pleace credit card and never take valuble things with you or put in the safe box Location is excellent  Rooms are small and the \"four poster\" frame around the beds encroach on valuable floor space  Bathroom clean and toiletries replenished every day  Good buffet breakfast but very rude staff in the breakfast room  Subway is very close by and good selection of bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity If you want a quite weekend away stay away from this Hotel  It\\'s very noisy both during the day and night  The bathrooms are very dirty and the staff very rude  Location is the worst, 2 of our staff members got mugged and pick pocketed on that street within 2 hours of arriving at the hotel  Upon departure one of the guests forgot a shirt on the wardrobe We emailed the hotel to see if it could be returned and didn\\'t get a reply, after chasing it a couple of time their reply was: \"as told you we are doing our best\"    Loved it here, great price, adorable single room, loved that\\'s surrounded by narrow streets, so much to explore from here and Tappas bar\\'s everywhere  Very safe for single female traveller  Will be backThe hotel is in a great location in the old town, the metro is just up the street which has an excellent service with trains every few minutes  The staff were very helpful and friendly  The hotel is quite dark but very pleasant, with free water, apples and a safe in the room  The breakfast was excellent and kept us going til mid afternoon  The bed was a bit on the hard side for us and it was noisy during the night, would suggest asking for a back room if your a light sleeper We stayed one of the suites at Banys Oriental for 2 nights  The room was huge with 30 foot ceilings and old world charm  However, for 2 people, it was a bit too big  I would have preferred a bathtub and a real king sized bed (vs 2 doubles put together) instead of the loft area, which we never used  It probably would have been great for a family with children  You could tell the room was due for some minor renovation  Not that anything was broken, but the the floors could have been fixed up and and bathroom upgraded  The best part was our suite was in the center of the building, so it was very quiet  The street is very loud at night, so I couldn\\'t imagine having spent the night in a street facing room  Overall, it was a very comfortable stay The Banys Orientals is a fantastic location in Barcelona with very friendly and helpful staff, although there are no oriental themes  The free apples are a nice touch as are the two computers on the first floor (although the wifi failed to work unless you were literally on top of the reception desk in the foyer when I was there) The surrounding ancient streets are a great area to ramble around, even if ladies are all phobic of their handbags being stolen, and there are lots of nearby cafes with special offers  You can literally walk everywhere from this location  The rooms were adequate, clean and comfortbale, although not huge  Check out the organic restuarant around the corner (Origens C/ Vidrieria, 6, 08003) The Banys Orientals is in a great location, reasonable value, and a very helpful staff  Our room, which we were told was one of the rooms with lots of light, was very dark and small  Next time we\\'ll bring a coal miner\\'s headlamp  They advertise WiFi in every room  Our experience with our iPhones did not meet our expectations  We had to go to the common areas to get a signal  We were told if we had a computer they could provide a cable for access; but, that isn\\'t WiFi  Still, our overall experience was very good largely because of the location and friendly staff Great location and very comfortable hotel  I had a single room  Very tiny but it had everthing I needed  I walked to the airport bus station about 15 minute walk with no problem even carrying luggage  Breakfast was good, with all kinds of extras [eg pine nuts] Dinner at the adjoining restaurant Senyor Pareuada - excellent and not overly expensive  Veal cheeks and pear and gazpacho  The hotel makes up for the small rooms by also providing all kinds of extras  Refirgerator in hall with bottles of water and bowls of apples for the guests to help themselves  Extra items beyond shampoo and soap provided Seconc time in Banys  Suite  Simply great  Can\\'t be better  Best area in town We stayed at the Banys Orientals for 3 nights in September  The hotel was in the prefect location close to everything  Very friendly staf  We stayed in a suite what I wouldn\\'t reccomend  Just stay at the normal rooms  Also 2 beds instead of one king bed, zo that was a bit disappointing    We stayed at the Banys Orientals for 3 nights in September, thanks to TripAdvisor recommendations  The hotel was in the prefect LOCATION close to metro, beach, the Gothic quarters, great restaurants, night life and shopping  Very friendly staff and I loved the decor     We would stay here again!I was recommended this hotel by a friend who was away on a girly holiday, I was on a romantic holiday  The location was unbelievable and our room was amazing, so crisp and clean  The room itself was a tiny bit small but the big 4 poster bed was worth it  I have recommended this hotel to many, couples and girly holidays  We didn\\'t eat in the hotel so I can\\'t comment in the food, so many nice restaurants just a short walk away  Would defintitely return My title says it all  Staying at this hotel was a delightful experience  The guests were young, mostly European and attractive, all adding to the ambiance  The neighborhood is marvelous, recently \"upscale and still a little rough  Hold onto your purse!I always tried to check if Banys Orientals has available rooms when I travel (with my spouse) to Barcelona    And I am never disappointed until now    Last time I got (was it a kind of upgrade?) a huge room in the \"extension\" of the hotel some 30 maters away in the same street  It was a hot period in Barcelona  The fact we were in the last floor (3rd) without a lift (even only for the luggage) was the only negative part  But    I will continue to check the possibility to go there, despite this problem!This hotel was a stylish break for us  In the perfect location, close to a neighbourhood of quirky shops and bars, it had comfortable rooms with free internet and bottles of chilled mineral water  Reception staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, and we loved the little touches, like the goody bag  The Banys was recommended by friends from New Zealand and it was just perfect With two kids, we had to take a suite, outside the main the hotel  The suite was very spacious and lovely, and included small treats we did not expect to get in a 3-stars hotel  It was not clear that the water in the minibar are free of charge (great for August heat)  Internet was not usable in the room (wifi or wire) - they said a techie checked and he said it was ok  That was it (Stayed in July 2010, not September 2010) My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights or so, and our holiday in Barcelona was made so much more enjoyable thanks to this hotel  Pros: - Location  It\\'s near a metro stop, so it\\'s easy to arrive and depart  It\\'s also very easy to get to other attractions through the metro stop, or by walking  At the same time, it\\'s just out of the main party areas so there isn\\'t much noise the whole night keeping you awake  - Service  The management was easy to deal with before arrival, and during our stay  They helped plan the best departure time to get to the airport, and recommended some fantastic restaurants (instead of being recommended whoever has left a flyer at the hotel)  - Comfort  I\\'m not too picky with hotel rooms, so I\\'ll just say that it was clean, comfortable, and everything worked that I needed (not sure about TV/Internet, etc)  There was also an unlimited supply of bottled water for anyone to use, which is extremely helpful for a summer holiday in Barca  I wish more hotels did this! Cons: None really  It\\'s only that the price matches the quality you get, and it\\'s hard to book in the high season (we tried again this year without success) Right in the center, not far away from the beach, Gaudi, metro, etc    We\\'ve stayed at Hotel Banys Orientals twice now, and we\\'ll definately be back! It\\'s reasonably priced (but beware that the prices are not including VAT) and we love the area! It\\'s a 5min walk to the harbour, 10min to the beach and most of the sights in the historic centre is easily accesable  We ate at plenty of great restaurants only a few min walk away- Cal Pep(one of the most well-known tapas bars in Barcelona), Senyor Paradella (in the same building as the hotel), Taller de Tapas, Celler de la Ribera   The metro station Jaume 1 is just right up the street  The breakfast is a bit pricy (10E/pers) but very good  (But we usually ate at a coffee place in v/Laietana  ) There\\'s free internet and free bottled water in refrigerators on every floor  The interior is beautiful, the rooms and bathroom are of a decent size, there\\'s a safe deposit box in every room  And there\\'s even slippers, toothbrushes and hairbrushes in the room  Although the walls are very thin, so you can hear a lot of what\\'s going on in the neighbouring rooms We didn\\'t have a room for a couple of nights and so called this hotel  The prices were almost have of the room we were staying in and the service was so much better  The 2nd night stay they didn\\'t have their regular room and so we stayed in the suite (more like a small apartment for about 30 euros more  The regular room had 2 beds and the bath   the suite had a king downstairs, a loft with a single upstairs  bath is upstair  There was also a mini fridge and armoir downstairs  The service was awesome  Food in their restaurant wasn\\'t 5 star but it was good!!! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!! (We were here in October 2009)Great little hotel in fab location with heaps of groovy eating places around and the metro 2mn walk away  Low points: staff had a bit of an attitude and we are still puzzled at having to eat breakfast in almost total darkness (   ???   )  The room was a good size, groovy and not so noisy even though facing the street (4or 5th floor mind you)  Again, v  low lights in the room and bathroom so get your torch ready if you are into precision make-up ! Nice touch free bottled water con y sin gas on each floor  The restaurant downstairs seemed very nice but the choice outside was too appealling to resist  All and all still great value for money Second time visit - I can\\'t fault this hotel for its location and value  It is fantastic value for money - you do not need to spend anymore to feel safe, happy and well looked after The rooms are still the same as 5 years ago, but they got it right the first time, and design wise still looking good Free WIFI, water, apples   and so many bars and food spots just outside the door  El born is around the corner, all the hip designer shops are there too, the Catedral is up around the corner, the beach down the road   and be sure to jump on the bus and see all of Gaudi\\'s wonders       ah Barcelona   I miss you!Spent 3 nights at Banys on friend\\'s reommendation  Great position and lovely boutique hotel  Had room on top floor which was a bit noisy as we could hear people in next room  Floors were timber and they also were noisy  However, we were hardly in our room as there is so much to see and do in Barcelona  The staff were very helpful and the restaurant at the hotel was fantastic and always seemed to be busy This hotel combines the most amazing location with amazing service  But the most amazing thing is the value  We stayed in several places in barcelona and by far this one is the best value  You wont\\' find a better combination  Book early and often!!We booked two rooms at this hotel in March  A double and twin  We were advised the week before we arrived that we were being relocated into two separate buildings away from the hotel  Too late to make any other arrangements we accepted this change  When we arrived we were shown to our rooms which were just up the street but were only accessible by stairs - 3 flights of stairs, which with 6 bags was a hassle  The rooms had only twin beds which was disappointing and wi fi was only accessible from one room  Overall if we had known well beforehand we weren\\'t going to get what we had booked we would have gone elsewhere The Banys Orientals has a perfect location near the underground Jaume I and in the middle of the old town  So, for the location, nothing could be better  However, if you do not take a suite, the rooms are quite small and dark  It was hard getting around in the room, since they had put in too much furniture  I did not understand why, but I could never use the Internet on my computer (too thick walls?)  An advantage is the mineral water you get for free, but on the other hand, it is quite cheap in Spain  The breakfast was quite authentic with nice varieties of ham and cheese  But unfortunately, it was quite dark in the restaurant, so you did not have the impression that it was broad daylight    The staff could be more attentive  We went back in the evening to get our suitcases to take the boat to Palma and left the hotel about 10 PM  My partner had not discovered that he had forgot his wallet in the room by that time, but I think that someone in the reception could have set up a sign saying that they had found a wallet in one of the roomes  Now, the wallet is sent to us to a cost of 35 euros   I traveled with two friends to Barcelona in June and loved Hotel Banys  We stayed in the suites down the block from the actual hotel  They were clean, comfortable, and spacious  The hotel also gave free water, fruit, and internet  In addition to being a great hotel the location was amazing  We could walk everywhere (beach, Las Ramblas, Placa de Catalunya, and Passeig de Gr\\xc3\\xa0cia)   We were also surrounded by good food and places to go out Staying at the Hotel Banys Orientals was an excellent experience  The rooms were clean and beautifully decorated and the hotel was in an amazing location  Our room was on the street side and was a bit loud at night - but were were in Barcelona for it\\'s lively culture so it did not bother us  (bring ear plugs though if you need quiet to sleep) We loved the hotel and would stay there again bed bug alert! this was my first trip to barcelona  the city, sights, and food were awesome! i loved this hotel because it\\'s cute, affordable, and central to touristy sights  the staff was really helpful and friendly  however, the 4th floor has bed bugs  i was in two different rooms and bitten several times throughout the week i was there in both rooms This hotel was simple and charming with a location that can\\'t be beat  Nestled on a vibrant pedestrian pathway (no cars), we could have spent hours people-watching from our perch on the sultry balcony  The neighborhood, Born-Ribera, is a feast for the eyes as you wind through the labyrinth and move through enticing bars, restaurants, and shops  We felt at home and enjoyed the warm and relaxed elegance of the hotel  The staff reciprocates polite behavior  We\\'ll stay again as soon as we can!The Hotel Banys Oriental has a few really good things going for it  It\\'s in the centre of the El Born district, in walking distance to everywhere  And its rooms are larger than average European hotel rooms (though from what I\\'ve seen on TripAdvisor they would still be smaller than American travellers might expect ) Our bed was comfy, the room spotless and the bathroom big and well appointed  Unbelievably good value for Barcelona  Our one warning is regarding bookings  We booked over the phone, only to arrive and find our booking had been made a year into the future! We still got a room and later, while chatting with a French couple over dinner in the restaurant downstairs, they told us they stay there every year and always book their room a year out to make sure they get one, so it was not such a surprise that the hotel thought we wanted a 2012 booking  The staff helped as they could and booked us a hotel for the night they couldn\\'t accommodate us (a more expensive place, but they negotiated it so we could pay their room rate ) As a plus, the hotel\\'s restaurant specialises in Catalonian food and our food there was excellent - we actually ate there twice, which is very unusual for us My wife & I visited Barcelona for the first time & stayed in this great boutique hotel where the staff, room, breakfast and location were excellent  It is ideally located in the historic area within easy walking to all the city\\'s highlights Provided free internet, bottled water 7 myself visited Barcelona for the first time in May 2011 We stayed at this lovely boutique hotel upon a glowing recommendation from a local travel agent All aspects of the hotel were stunning: the room, the staff, the breakfast and the location which is within the historic area with easy walking access toA first trip to a new destination can be a bit overwhelming and go wrong on so many levels, so needless to say when looking for a hotel in Barcelona I was a bit nervous and asked a friend for recommendations  She suggested Hotel Banys Orientals for it\\'s prime location and unbeatable rates, and very happy she did so  I later found out that the staff is professional, super helpful and really friendly; the rooms are really cute and the cleaning staff takes pride in the quality of their services  Whether you visit Barcelona for a night or two weeks Hotel Banys Orientals is the place to stay We stayed at Banys Orientals for 3 nights in May  We stayed in room 203  It was a smaller room, but our bathroom was great  Huge shower, great water pressure, and a separate toilet room  The air conditioning worked, but only if the floor to ceiling windows were closed - so eco aware! There was a safe and a large wardrobe for hanging  The only problem was that due to the location of our room, we only got wifi in the bathroom  The staff could not have been nicer and more helpful  The last day of our stay our flight was cancelled and the staff at reception booked us back into the hotel, helped us call our airline and insurance company (at least 5 different international numbers), and they did it while not making us feel like we were a burden  And when we arrived before our room was ready we were told we would change in the bathrooms, use the free internet, and take advantage of the free water  They also stored our bags securely before we checked in and after we checked out  The location was perfect  So so easy to get to from the airport if you are taking the aerobus and right in the middle of the Old City  The Juame 1 metro station was 100 meters from the hotel, 5 minute walk from The Picasso Museum and Santa Maria del Mar was 2 blocks away  There was great nightlife in our area, locals and tourists alike wandering around the streets and having tapas and drinks  Only 10-15minutes walk to La Rambla, 20 minute walk to beach, 5 minute walk to Port Vell, and only a 5 minute walk to the Hop on/off bus tour stop  Banys also provides free water in refrigerators on each floor  We took huge advantage of this - would have paid a fortune for water otherwise! It was such a nice bonus! We could not recommend Banys Orientals more  A great place to explore Barcelona from I stayed at Banys for 3 nights in May 2011 with my wife and 5 yo son We had a suite near to the main building,very spacious and comfortable The location is perfect,close to Ramblas,zoo,barcelonetta,aquarium,pl Catalunya and metro station The guys at reception desk were very helpful and kind,breakfast was good except from service (there was only 1 waiter serving many tables) There was free internet but never could connect with my i phone We liked it very much and we\\'ll stay again next time we visit Barcelona Stayed in one of the suites for 4 nights in June 2010  Fantastic room, and in all senses a terrific stay  Have already booked for September 2011 We booked for three nights after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and found the previous reviews to be pretty much spot-on  We requested a quiet room and were given a room at the back of the hotel on the first floor  The room was small but clean and perfectly adeqate as a base from which to explore the city  The bed was large and comfortable  the bathroom was adequate with an excellent shower, although a little dark  Complementary toiletries were provided, as well as bottled water (from the fridge on the first floor) and free access to internet via a couple of desktop PCs in the public areas  Location was pretty much perfect for us, - just 50m from the metro and about 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas, the Cathedral and other sights  Plenty of local bars, restaurants and Tapas  There was some noise in the morning from external construction work but this was outside the control of the hotel  We ate once in the attached restaurant which was good value for money  Overall the hotel offers good value for money and deserving of its rating on Tripadvisor  We would be happy to stay there again if we return to Barcelona Our family of three has experienced various types of rooms in Europe but the Hotel Banys Orientals suite was remarkably spacious  The suites are located fifty feet or so from the hotel entrance so we almost felt as though we had an apartment with all the amenities of a hotel  Our daughter had her own small loft just above our bedroom It was also very conveniently located for most of the attractions of Barcelona either by walking or by using the nearby metro station  The amenities included easily accessed WiFi(slower speeds than we are used to but more than enough for browsing the web) and free bottles of water and fruit  Overall an experience we would repeat We stayed here based on the positive reviews from Tripadvisor and weren\\'t disappointed  Very affordable boutique hotel in a great location  Clean, good size rooms  Free bottled water and fruit  The hotel was a bit noisy (restaurants close by and construction) but otherwise good experience The hotel is excellent located close to the Ramblas, many very good restaurants and the metro  Although the rooms are a little small, they are very clean and provide good value for many  The staff are friendly (like most people in Barcelona)  Overall, a great city made more enjoyable by this hotel My husband and I have just returned from 4 days here  We loved the hotel ,the rooms whilst small were great and white cotton bedding and clean rooms  Lots of little touches like toilet bags and things you may of fprgotten  The staff were very helpful and gave us lots of help with places to eat and things to see  Very good valueTrendy, clean, WiFi, good location, friendly staff, no complaints other than local noise which is typical for BarcelonaWe have just returned from a week holiday in Barcelona and our French friend has recommended us HBO  Initially we thought it was just another hotel but it sure turned out to be an excellent hotel with very strategic locality to many tourist spots within walking distance  We also find the restaurant within the hotel to be an excellent recommendation with nice food with affordable prices This was our 2nd visit to the hotel both times staying in the suites a few blocks from the hotel  We were there 3 years ago and enjoyed the hotel so much we went back again  Wonderful staff and the suite rooms are quite large  Very quiet and yet centrally located so you can walk everywhere  No more than a 10 minute walk to the Rambla yet you are in a wonderful neighborhood with lots of restaurants and tapas bars  We are looking forward to our next visit to Barcelona and we would certainly return to the Banys Orientals This hotel is one of the only that\\'s wearth its priceThe rooms are airy and beautiful, clean and simply decorated  The restaurant beneath the hotel is fantastic  We ate there several times over the course of the trip  The downside to having such a great restaurant under the hotel is that there was pretty substantial noise all night--people talking, waitstaff yelling, bottles being thrown out, etc  Plus, someone got mugged in the alley behind the hotel  The amount of noise was impressive, but that\\'s what you get in a city  The real problem was the mustiness of the bathroom  Although it was a good-looking bathroom, there was no ventilation, and subsequently there was mold, mildew, or a combination growing behind the walls or in places I couldn\\'t see  But man, oh, man, could we smell it! After a few days of the exposure, I was unable to sleep due to a severe allergy flare up  As a positive, they give free bottled water to their guests In the middle of the old city, surrounded by bars and little shops, very nice place at a very reasonable rates, huge rooms clean and with all the services  Breakfast a bit disappointingIf you think this bargain boutique hotel in the Born is too good to be true, you\\'re right, it is  The suite we stayed in was roomy but poorly appointed, cold at night with only one blanket provided, the beds too hard, the WiFi never worked, it was noisy day and night and the bathroom was worn out and grimy  After we had checked out we realised that we had absent-mindedly left behind a couple of items of shopping in our room; although we were assured that these would be promptly shipped to us to the UK, they never were  After sending the management repeated emails asking what had happened to these items I only got any kind of response when I told them I was going to write them up on Trip Advisor if they didn\\'t offer me some sort of explanation  Then all they did was strenuously assure me that they only had their guests best interests at heart, but they couldn\\'t produce our shopping and they didn\\'t make any attempt to make it right  A very low rent attitude from a low rent outfit indeed I stayed at the Banys Oriental in the Born district in Barcelona in November with my husband and some friends  It was a terrific experience! The rate was great for the high quality of the hotel and the incredible location  It is just off a main road, but far enough that it is quiet at night  In the middle of the tangles streets of the Born district with terrific restaurants, shops, pinotxo bars and really close to the Picasso Museum  The rooms are clean and decent sized with a comfortable bed and internet available  Bathrooms are beautiful, and the front desk folks are very helpful  I would definitely stay here again We stayed in the suites five minutes walk from the hotel  Very nice and spacious  Hotel staf very friendly and helpful to all kinds of questions and directions we had  Would highly recommend it, but I think we\\'re settling with the regular rooms next time Terrific location  This hotel recommended in Lonely Planet guide book so we requested 2 suites  On arrival at hotel taken to our suites in a different building close-by in a dodgy looking alleyway  Suites were accessed by one entrance with good security but once in the building the lighting was inadequate  Dangerous on the stairs  The rooms were spacious but it would have been nice to have had tea and coffee facilities  Breakfast was extra and we walked to the main hotel for this  It was plentiful and a good variety  Staff at main reception friendly but one breakfast staff not so We opted for a \"suite\" which was in a separate building a short walk from the main hotel and it was perfect for what we needed  The room was very spacious, much larger than any of the other rooms I have stayed in in Spain  Front desk staff were nice and helpful when our luggage arrived late and again when we had to have our rail passes that we forgot fedex\\'d to us overnight  The location was great, walking distance to many sights, restaurants, bars, and very close to the subway too  Free wi-fi was a bonus Hotel - very nice design Rooms - nice design and very well equipped  Free bottled water and WIFI  However, way to small and really tired, The bathroom was mouldy and the shower was broken, Flooring coming up  Service - awful  Everything too much trouble  I was even refused the loan of a pen  Location - fantastic  In the middle of everything  Value - despite the above problems, the hotel is good value at 99 euroThis hotel was quite a find - it is very central and located in the lively Born district  Very good value for what you get  The hotel itself quite small but the rooms are clean and functional - the whole place has a \"boutique\" feel to it  Free bottles of mineral water and apples on the landings are a nice touch  The location on a busy pedestrian street means that some rooms can be noisy until late at night - a lesser evil compared with the traffic noise on many other Barcelona streets  There is no problem finding somewhre to eat or drink nearby - within a five minute walk you are spoilt for choice  Try Bar Bubo in the Placa Santa Maria del Mar, right opposite the cathedral, for a drink and tapas We stayed at Banys Orientals for 2 nights, we were allocated a room at the back of the building  It was fairly small, but had everything needed, including free safety box, flat screen tv, comfortable bed, good shower and bathroom  It is in a good location, within 2 minutes of the metro and only a 10 minute or so walk from Plaza Catalunya where the airport bus drops off  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and the bonus of free bottled water and fruit on each floor was welcomed  We found it a great location to explore Barcelona  Walking distance to the port/beach area and also to the Ramblas  Overall a great place to stay in Barcelona  They were completely full when we stayed, as I\\'m sure they are most days, hence why they do not have the need for online booking  Very easy to book via email though  I would certainly recommend I stayed at the Banys Orientals w/ my wife and young children (ages btw 2 - 6) in August  We stayed in one of the Annex Suites in a building right next to the hotel  It was a very large room w/ two double beds downstairs and another bed in the loft upstairs  It was very roomy and clean w/ a large modern bathroom and was perfect for the whole family  Although we were in the Annex the room was immaculately maintained by the staff and we were only about 10 meters from the front desk  And for Barcelona it was a great deal at 130 Euros a night  Besides really liking the hotel itself, one of best aspects of it is the location in the heart of El Born neighborhood  Its on a nice quiet pedestrian street lined w/ great restaurants and a very short walk to the historic Santa Maria del Mar church  We ate at Taller de Tapas twice (our trip also included La Rioja, Asturias - where my wife is from and Segovia before flying out Madrid) and it was our favorite tapas place in all of Spain  We also had dinner at Senyor Parellada for classic filling Catalan cuisine, which was an amazing meal and amazingly cheap for the quality, portions and fine dining service  Besides the immediate neighborhood the hotel is basically a ten minute walk or less to the Catedral, La Rambla, La Boqueria Market, the waterfront / Aquarium and the Parque Ciutadella and Barcelona Zoo  Our children really loved all of these attractions (OK, maybe not the cathedral so much   ) which made the hotel a great location for families  And besides that it was an easy few stop metro (located a 1/2 block from the hotel) to La Sagrada Familia, again making it very convenient for most of the main tourist attractions  Speaking of the metro though    while on it we were one of the many tourists in Barca who get pick pocketed and basically were targeted b/c of the kids  Although this was a very frustrating afternoon the front desk (and Camilla in particular) were EXCELLENT in helping us deal w/ our credit cards, get a police report and most importantly contacting the Motor Vehicle Dept in the US to receive a faxed abstract of my DL so I could still rent a car and continue on w/ our journey across Spain  They really went above and beyond what would be expected and for that I am still grateful  So although we loved the hotel anyway due to the Annex Suite and great location in El Born, it was the service provided during this stressful moment that both helped salvage our trip and prompted me to share my experience and strongly recommend their establishment  I hope you don\\'t encounter what we did but if so rest assured that the hotel will go out of its way to help This is a 3-star hotel that is just beautiful and located close to everything! I would definitely stay here again, and definitely recommend to others  I\\'m glad I booked in advance because once I arrived and checked-in, I found that they were completely booked  I was traveling solo, and booked a single room for the first two nights  The single room was small (the bathroom was almost as large as the sleeping area!)  My third night I transferred to a double room which was really much more spacious, but of course a bit more expensive  There is internet and A/C in the room, it\\'s very comfortable, and very quiet  There is also a restaurant on-site, but I did not try it  The location cannot be beat    it is right smack in the middle of everthing in the central part of downtown, maybe a 10-15 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya, 10 minutes to Las Ramblas, and a minute or two to all the wonderful tapas bars  The staff here is absolutely fantastic  I can\\'t think of anything negative about this place - except it would be nice if the price were a bit lower but hey, this is Barcelona so you\\'re going to pay a bit more The Hotel Suite they put us in is away from the Hotel itself, has no lift and the stairs are not suitable for seniors, myself, husband & mature daughter had two flights of steps, my older brother in law and his wife had 4 flights of steps to conquer, a challenge you might say, a virtual nightmare i would say as it has not much lighting and the suites although quite large were dark inside and the bathrooms were extremely dark/musty and mouldy  We were extremely disappointed as when we made a complaint to change rooms no feed back was given, we then requested to view the rooms in the real part of the hotel, they had at least a lift and the room shown is the one on the internet site not the ones we were put in  The location is very good though and near the barri gotic the port and not far from La Rambla no complaints re the location  If booking this hotel please request the rooms where the lift is located or if you can find another Hotel book that one We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Banys Orientals  Its a stylish hotel in a great neighborhood that\\'s perfect for exploring Barcelona  Only two minor drawbacks worth mentioning: (1) ht even with a room on the back, its can be pretty loud with the noise from the street; (2) from time the wi-fi would go out We stayed at Banys on our honeymoon this August  We had one of the suites, which lay about 50m from the reception  The room was large with stairs leading to a kind of second floor  In some of the other rewiews people have made remarks about noise from the street, especially if the room faces l\\'argenteria street  There is a lot of pedestrians walking this street in the evening, and there is a lot of citysounds if the windows are open  This did not bother us at all, and when there was time for sleep the balcony doors where sufficiently soundisolated  The location is very good in the heart of the old town  20min walk to the beach, 10min to the shoppingstreet, a lot of good restaurants just down the street  We recomend Taverna de Cobra, great tapas  Estruch right outside Barcelona Cathedral has great lunches  + free water each day i the refridgerator balcony - very low pressure in the shower no wireless network(but cable can be provided in the reception) breakfast should be included PS  visit Aire de Barcelona for a very nice spatreatment  The touristguides does not mention it but we recomend it  Be sure to book in good time!Although I found this hotel as recommended by Conde Nast Travaler magazine in 2006, I would strongly advise not to stay there  I guess a lot has changed since 2006  Upon our arrival we were treated with great disprespect by the reception staff, they were trying to make us pay for one extra bed although the previous arrangments were made months before  Upon my notice that we had already agreed upon everything before, Mr  Juan Pablo at the reception explained that he has arrived at 3:00 PM that day and he does not care about my arranagments  In the meantime Mrs  Emelie from the reception was just smiling at our conversation and considered everything to be a good joke  There was no one on the duty responsible that evening, so we could not really speak to anybody else  The manager\\'s name was declined to us  The best part happened when we tried to check out - there was an attempt to charge us double price presuming we had not paid1/2 for the hotel before  Again we needed to enter into discussions and prove our point  So, my advise is to avoid this hotel if you want a stay without arguing to the staff  Also about safety - the rooms can be accessed throught the balconies from the street  The sign on the balcony\\'s door says - please close when out of room and while sleeping for your own safety  One day when we came back to the room after being away for the whole day, the balcony\\'s door was wide open since the cleaner had opened it and forgotten to close it On our recent honeymoon to Spain, Barcelona was our first stop  We wanted a reasonably priced, well situated, safe place to stay to help us discover all the city\\'s charms, and Hotel Banys Orientals could not have been a better choice! The location is great  There are hip shops and restaurants right outside the door, but the side street on which the Hotel is located does not create a lot of street noise  You are incredibly close to a Metro Stop and also within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and many other attractions including a short walk to the beach! One of our favorite things to do was to walk outside and get lost in the charming streets of the Gothic neigborhood  Unlike the more hectic sections of the city, we never felt unsafe in the immediate vicinity of the hotel  The staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations and any questions that we had  The fridge full of free water (both with and without gas) and the free internet were also nice bonuses! Although on the smaller side, our corner room was not as small as some of the rooms we had seen in Spain and it also allowed us privacy  It was clean and comfortable  We enthusiastically recommend both the city of Barcelona and this hotel as a base within its charms  Buen viaje!Stayed for 6 days in June, concerned by earlier reviews mentioning noise  In city-centre Spain it will never be silent, but noise levels for my room opening onto alley at side of hotel were acceptable  Rooms small but perfectly formed and very well kept  Internet functioned well and hotel staff very friendly and helpful  Restaurant on ground floor has very good food at reasonable prices  Very good value indeed The Banys Orientals is a beautiful hotel right in the heart of Barcelona  After a bus ride from the airport you arrive at the hotel which lies in a small side street where no cars can go  The reception is tiny yet entering the building towards the back the true beauty unfolds  A classic restaurant with balconies above your head  A mellow lighting complements the entire look perfectly  The rooms are modern and very comfortable  Plenty of space for suitcases and clothes  The bathroom is also very nice and I was positively surprised about the little welcome present  My next trip to Barcelona will certainly take me there again Banys Oriental is first of all in an absolutely perfect spot of Barcelona  Ive been to Barcelona before and this area is really where to stay  It is very good value for the money - clean, lovely architecture and very stylish decorated - Very nice bathroom and very comfortable beds  Complimentary waters and apples added to the great stay  What you see on ther wep page is really what you get  Some has written that the rooms are a bit small - I don\\'t know what they compare to, being in the middle of an european city and being a 3 star hotel I found the room normal size, not small at all  I\\'ve heard it can be noice from the street - I am not surprised, there are lots of businesses and restaurants on the street  We requested a quiet room and had the best sleep in a long time  We didnt have a balcony but that was fine for us  Breakfast is more than great  Here as well you really get your money worth  We only had breakfast once though - there are som many caf\\xc3\\xa9s and restaurnants in the neighbourhood that need to be discoverd  = ) Only bad thing is that the breakfast room was a bit dark  We paid around 100 euro a night and I consider that a very resonable price for this lovely hotel  I will be back = )Have just returned from a 2 night break in Barcelona  We stayed at the Hotel Banys Orientals and loved it  The rooms were very clean, minimalistic and the shower powerful and refreshing  After reading other comments about noise etc  I emailed the hotel and asked for a room on the top floor away from any obvious sources of noise  I was not disappointed  The walls are not the thickest but apart from the occasional sound of conversation next door we were not troubled  The beds were comfortable and we slept really well  We did have long, busy days though  We decided to take breakfast in the hotel and there was always plenty of choice with staff refilling empty dishes efficiently  We were set for the day after eating  The staff at reception were very friendly with welcoming \\'Holas\\' every time we passed through reception  They quickly answered our questions and phoned several of the churches to supply us with a very comprehensive list of mass times  They also gave us some good shopping tips  The location is very central with many nice bars, restaurants and shops close by  I would certainly think about booking this hotel if I was to return to Barcelona in the futureWe stayed in this hotel in Barcelona for 4 nights in April 2010  Firstly, the location is simply brilliant, right in the heart of El Born and the Old City  The building is beautiful, the staff are wonderful and the food in the attached restaurant was delicious and authentic  I recommend the Oxtail, and the Anchovies with bread  Great olives served up in paper cones and divine wines  The restaurant looks and feels like a Michelin starred restaurant  OK, so here come the cons  Noise  We were staying in one of the suites which are located in a building further down the street  Our room overlooked the street  Firstly, it was very noisy, Argentera is a main pedestrian thoroughfare and our first night (a Saturday) was spent awake until 6am when the church bells rang out  There was loud singing and shouting from revellers, it sounded like a carnival out there! The hotel cannot be held responsible for this but it would be sensible to insulate the windows better  Light  The buildings are old, in those days they built buildings in Spain to be tall and close together to create some shelter from the fierce midday sun   as a result, the buildings are designed to be dark but the management need to provide better lighting, the lighting in the rooms from table lamps to reading lights etc was all wrong and generally not bright enough  We wanted to open the curtains fully to let in as much natural daylight as possible but couldn\\'t because of the office building across the way and people looking in  It really did feel like a dark cave in there  Internet Access  There is wifi internet in the building but the base station emitting the signal is too far away from the suites we stayed in and we therefore couldn\\'t get online  This was actually a fairly major thing for me as I needed to keep in touch with work stuff in case deadlines were missed and not being able to check emails from the room was a pain  Some simple and inexpensive changes would turn a good hotel into a great hotel  How difficult would it be to change the lightbulbs to be a brighter wattage, put a new router near the suites to increase the signal for internet and put in some double glazing? We would definitely go again but we would choose a room in the main hotel, higher up to get the maximum natural daylight  We cannot fault the staff who always greeted us a with a smile and a Hola and who helped as much as they could Stayed while attending a conference  The rooms were clean and comfortable, although small  There were extra toiletries stocked in the room and even a pair of slippers; however, there was no clock and no refrigerator  Free WiFi in the rooms was slow, but functional  Breakfast provided a good variety of foods  The location of the hotel is excellent, with easy walking to public transportation, the Cathedral of Barcelona, many restaurants and shops  I would have rated this hotel more highly but the noise at night was a problem  I was often awakened around midnight by \"dumpster\" noises of emptying trash, breaking bottles, and slamming metal, as well as by loud talking of workers from a nearby restaurant  This lasted for at least an hour  The sound insulation of the rooms was not effective, either  I could hear my neighbour talking loudly at 2 a m  and hallway traffic (with closing doors) was disturbing  So, if you are a very sound sleeper, or if you can get a room away from the alley and restaurant, this may be a good choice of place to stay  It is not the place to stay if you need quiet at night  I would recommend with reservations I stayed two nights at this hotel during the summer and was not disappointed  I booked a suite because there were no regular rooms available  The suite was next door and had a separate entrance  The space was immaculate; very clean, modern, loft-like with exposed gothic beams  Free water (still & sparkling), apples, internet and huge comfortable bed  The location is excellent  A 10 minute walk from many tourist areas including Las Ramblas, Barceloneta, Picasso Museum, etc  and right next to a parking lot and the metro  There are only a few negative things that I can think of  One is that there was no elevator so my heavy luggage had to be carried up and down the stairs  The second is that the hotel is somewhat hidden and is hard to find  I didn\\'t try the food so I can\\'t comment on that  Overall, a very cool boutique hotel with helpful employees  I visit Barcelona every year and I\\'ll definitely stay there again next summer This is a quaint hotel in a great location! The rooms are very clean and comfortable  My favorite detail about the room were the floor to ceiling french doors that opened for me to look out in to the alley  I had a second floor room above the kitchen to the restaurant connected to the hotel  I heard a few pots and pans clang together and trash bags being thrown out  That lasted until about 2 am and then it was quite  Next time, I will request a room on a higher floor  The hotel is very convenient to the trains-up the road a half block and then cross the street  I\\'ll be going back in Feb  2010, so I\\'ll let you know how that goes The Hotel is minutes away from the metro in a good part of Barcelona  The rooms were comfortable, although a bit hard to find  The suites are in a totally different building on a different street, but secluded with an apartment like feel  The breakfast was not anything special, but the staff was friendly My wife and I booked a room for 2 nights just after Christmas after reading a great review in The Times of London Travel magazine  We were put in the handicapped room on the first floor  It was directly next to the kitchen staff doors  We were woken up at 1:30 in the morning with doors slamming and loud talking by the staff  This persisted and I went to the front desk to complain  Nothing could be done  Then the trash from the restaurant was being taken out at almost 2 in the morning directly under our room and outside the window  We could not sleep at all  We decided to leave the hotel in the middle of the night as this was insane  The front staff locked us in until I paid the bill for the night  We paid and went out find a hotel at 2 in the morning  This ruined our trip entirely  I have written to the hotel about this experience and no response 5 days later  Nothing  The worst thing is that this is where they put people who may have a handicap - that\\'s terrible  We were able to pack our bags and leave, but not everybody can do that, especially in a wheelchair  Shame on them  This was the worst hotel experience anywhere in the world, ever  Do not give them your business Great small hotel, lovely room, good restaurant and close to some great shops, bars and restaurants  A 10 minute walk from the Ramblas and other touristy areas This hotel has a lot going for it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 clean, comfortable rooms, nice extras \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like high end toiletries and a great location  The free bottled water was a nice extra  Now we know we were in Barcelona and there would be street noise and that can be strangely pleasant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you feel like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part of the town you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re visiting but the walls in this hotel are so thin you hear everything and we do mean EVERYTHING that our neighbors were doing  In addition, the elevator makes a loud spaceship like noise throughout the night as people come and go  Reception was pleasant enough and there are plenty of great places to dine in the immediate area  One place that stood out was Tast \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just a couple of doors down from the hotel on the right We were delighted to return to this gem of an hotel despite our less than complimentary review off the suites (external to the hotel)  No hesitation in recommending this hotel unreservedly  Remains a great place to stay and retains all that impressed us the first time round many years ago - a rare achievement  Great location, great staff - well done!We stayed in the suites for 4 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon  It was great to have so much space and feel so at home - we felt we just had our own little flat in Barcelona  The suite was easily accessible and just a 2 minute walk from the main hotel and you could phone the hotel for any thing you needed  They cleaned our rooms each day and refilled our fridge with water, which was complimentary  They had wi-fi as well as computers for use  The location is perfect because you\\'re not in the touristy hub-bub of Las Ramblas but only about 10-15 minute walk to it, if you want to see some of those sights  You\\'re also just around the corner from one of the tourist bus stops, which was perfect for us to get oriented to the city  The staff was so helpful in getting our luggage in the room for us, they also assisted us in making reservations for dinner  The hotel is decorated in a very contemporary way and is lovely  They are also very close to the metro if you want to take it  The adorable cobblestone streets of El Born are lovely and filled with great restaurants, bars and shops  We also stayed in a regular room at the end of our trip (we took a 1 week cruise and stayed one night upon our return before flying home)  The regular room was also nice but much smaller  I was glad we opted for more space for our longer stay, as we felt so at home and not cramped at all  We can\\'t wait til our next trip to Barcelona and Banys A lovely hotel in an excellent location  We found our room to be a good size, spotlessly clean and well equiped  The room was looking out on to the street which was lovely in the daytime and evening but be aware that refuse trucks do come down here at night so if you think this might bother you, definately request a back room  We had breakfast in the hotel on one morning which was a bit chaotic but the choice of foods available on the buffet was excellent  We\\'d also recommend Taller de tapas just up the street  We also tried the restaurant, Senyor Parellada, on one evening which was a bit of a disappointment  The staff seemed rushed off their feet and we were left for ages without even having a drinks order taken  When we eventually did get our food, my boyfriend\\'s starter was not what he had ordered and despite telling two different memebers of staff, we gave up and just ate what we had been given and left  We really enjoyed Lonja de tapas (near the picasso museum) and would definately recommend that as an alternative  Overall, this hotel is a great find that offers good value for money in an absolutely fantastic city There are many good reviews of this small hotel and it is certainly in the most perfect location for a Barcelona visit  Unfortunately, the wall to our room was paper thin and I had to bang on it in the night to stop our neighbour snoring  There is a good buffet breakfast but it tends to be a bit fraught with all the guests filling up  An alternative is the Taller de Tapas at no 51 which has a good breakfast menu (from 9am) and is a bit more relaxed  Newspapers from the vendor at the Metro entrance at the top of the street We stayed 3 nights in the hotel and 1 night in the suites because of booking issues (that we were told about in advance)  Most of my comments are re the hotel  First, the bad  This hotel looks chic, but it was all done on the cheap and now it\\'s showing its age  Nothing major, just a lot of little things that, taken together, made it seem shabby  The floors were fake wood and were buckling, giving a weird squishy uneven feeling when you walked around, the magnifying mirror (which you sort of had to use because it was lighted and the bathroom was so dark) had broken and was floppy so you had to hold it up to look in it, the sink plugs had broken off their chains and were just left that way, stuff like that  Also there was dust on the tables and lamps, the floor felt gritty, and the idea to paint the shower black wasn\\'t a good one because the housekeepers are apparently unable to remove the white water grime  The room we had 3 nights faced a side street and didn\\'t have much street noise when the windows were closed, but it was right by the elevator, which was quite loud  Also had a very ill-mannered American woman across the hall the first night who evidently had a spat with her boyfriend and was slamming doors and yelling for an extended period starting around 2:30 in the morning  Not exactly the hotel\\'s fault, but I felt like it was sort of the kind of place that attracts the wrong clientele or something  The room was dark  There was no wifi available, even in the lobby, but there were two computers for guest use  I think there were DSL connections in the rooms, but we hadn\\'t brought a laptop, just iphones  The good  Complimentary bottled water was a perk  The air conditioning worked well  Location was excellent, just a half block from the metro and right in the heart of great shopping and restaurants  I liked the neighborhood best of any we visited in Barcelona - a nice feel with little narrow streets, not much traffic, a very young crowd  Graffiti focused on political themes, which to my mind is best if there has to be graffiti  There was a little restaurant close by called Bubo that we ate at several times and liked a lot  Best coffee we found anywhere in Spain, for one thing, and the desserts were fantastic  The suite: not technically a suite, but much larger, quieter, and it was nice not to have to exchange fake smiles with the hotel desk staff, who were not exactly friendly  The suites are a few blocks away from the hotel, and we never saw another soul in the building while we were there  I might have felt a little uncomfortable if I had been alone, especially with the sign telling you not to sleep or leave the room with the window open  But as it was, it was sort of nice  The suite had the same decor, but didn\\'t have the same shabby feel our room in the hotel did Despite the pathetic value of the British pound against the Euro, this hotel still offers excellent value for money in a fantastic location  Rooms are spotlessly clean and whilst not huge are extremely comfortable, with a small balcony overlooking the street below  Free still and sparkling water and fruit is provided on each floor which is a really nice gesture, where other hotels would put it in your room and then charge an extortionate price for it  Didn\\'t bother trying the breakfast which is a reasonable 10 euros since the hotel is surrounded by plenty of places to grap a drink, quick snack or a meal  Great sandwiches which are big enough for two are avaiable at the nearby \"La Colmena\" pastisseria, for 3 euros  The location is one of the best things about this hotel, being close to all the major sights and transport links without ever feeling too touristy  There are loads of really cool drinking bars, restaurants, shops, cafes, ice cream shops and tapas bars all around this area, many hidden in quiet narrow side streets which you can spend hours exploring  Pintxos must be the best invention ever  ! The area is fairly busy but I didn\\'t notice the noise, although in fairness we were out quite late ourselves What an elegant little beauty, well-located to experience Barcelona! The staff is courteous and helpful; the rooms, beautiful  Our only concern was the air conditioning, which we couldn\\'t seem to manage well, but if we had raised the concern - we didn\\'t-- I feel certain the staff would have helped  And there\\'s free, fast Internet service in the room  It was a pleasure to come back to the hotel each evening We stayed in Banys for two nights, just to spend the Weekend in Barcelona and found it very nice and comfortable  I lived for one year in Barcelona and know the city centre very well  Bany Orientals is located perfectly in the heart of the G\\xc3\\xb3tico Area and you really find everything near to you (even Metro and Bus)  The value you get for the money you pay is above average for Barcelona  Even for bad Hostals I paid only 20 EUR less, compared to Banys Orientals, if you like the Hostal rooms with own bathroom  The Hotel has a very nice abstract and cosy style, the breakfast is very good and the service as well  If you get a room to the street it is of corse not very silent, but this is the charme of the mediteranean City of Barcelona  Some small things of course are nice to see, but not very good to use  The lightning of the bathroom indeed should be improved (especially at the sink and mirror), but this wasn\\xc2\\xb4t really a problem  I felt very good \"at home\" in the Banys Orientals rooms  Especially our room had two levels  Entering you could go directly in the bathroom/WC  Going some steps down (wooden steps in the material of the floor, very nice!) there was a hugh bed that was of a good quality  A small balcony to look, what is going on on the street, a big window with good curtains (no light enters at morning!) a small table with nice lamps on it, pictures on the wall - all those things made it overall a nice space to stay  Not very big, but to relax after walks through Barcelona  I will go to BO again  Definitely A great hotel!! Very central location, close to the beach, the shopping area, etc  Breakfast was super - tortillas, manchego, ham    Beautiful, oriental-like design  Free Internet access! We asked for one of the suites, located two minutes away from the hotel itself, to avoid noice  Happy about that  If you want to stay at this hotel in July and August, you should book early  We made a reservation in February/March Stayed at the Banys Orientals hotel 23rd to 26 July \\'09  We arrived at the hotel very late on the 23rd, there were 6 of us, so 2 taxis from the airport to the hotel cost 32 euros each  Check in was really easy and we were greeted by our names which was a nice touch (and very easy I am guessing by process of elimination of guest arrivals)  We were given rooms 101, 102 and 403  101/102 were two twin rooms and 403 was a double bed  On each floor was a fridge containing still & sparkling water, and also fruit on the 4th  A couple of nights, we requested an iron/ironing board - which were brought to the room in less than 5 mins each time  There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom and two amentity kits should you need them    toothbrush, comb   sponge etc  Everyone (all the staff) was really friendly and polite      and actually really helpful  The size of the rooms were ok, i wouldnt say large but i have stayed in a lot smaller, say in Paris  So very happy and i would most definitely stay there again and highly recommend  The Bus Turistic stops literally 2 mins from the hotel - near the beach - near everything really This was my 4th time in this hotel and I still like it as one of the best situated hotels in Barcelona - if you want to enjoy evenings out not using a cab but just finding the nicest places in walking distance from your hotel  The rooms aren\\'t very spacious, but you find everything you need (all the standards like TV, safe,    ) with one exception: there is no mini bar in the room  Instead you have a big fridge on every store where you find mineral water (still & sparkling) for free(!!!), as well as a basket with fruits  The service is very nice and helpful  In the basement of the hotel is a very famous restaurant, but there are so many others around, and tapas and wine bars,     that I still haven\\'t been there  Don\\'t forget to have a look at Santa Maria del Mar, the church is not even a 5 min walk away and on a Saturday you may be sure to see a real Spanish wedding  What I like best is the situation of the hotel and the quietness inside although being in the middle this throbbing atmosphere of Barcelona  What I like least: the bathrooms begin to age a bitGood mid range hotel in very good location  Tube is 2 min walk away, lots of bars and reataurants on your doorstep, other main attractions such as Placa Rei, Ramblas, Gotic all less than 12 min walk away  Free internet, water and air con  Found the staff helpful when organising transport back to the airport  It is very noisy so ask for an interior room if you think that will be a problem and if you like a tea or coffee first thing in the morning take a travel kettle as one is not provided  (Great takeaway coffee shop towards the church at the bottom of the road, not open until 10 ) Would definitely go back Hotel Banys Orientals, in Barcelona\\'s Bourne district is a great deal  For 99 euros our room was reasonably large, very modern and immaculately clean  Two high speed internet terminals were available 24 hours a day  The location was great, with lots of people coming and going, numerous tapas bars and retaurants on the narrow street right outside the hotel\\'s front door  The hotel restaurant, open to thre public was quite popular for dinner although we did not eat there, enjoying the tapas bars instead  If you would like to start the day with a solid meal the hotel\\'s optional extra cost buffet breakfast (10 euros) is worthwhile We stayed in Banys for five days in May and I can\\'t reccomend this hotel enough  The location is fantastic and I think for the price the hotel was outstanding  We requested a quiet room so I can\\'t comment on the noise but it is down a busy pedestrianised street so I can imagine a room at the front of the hotel would be noisy  The room we had was small but perfectly adequate for our needs, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom well equipped  The staff were generally not that friendly but they were helpful when we asked for anything  We didn\\'t find the restaurant at the hotel to be that great  Cal Pep near by is great for lunch or informal dinner and if you want somewhere special but expensive the restaurant Noti is amazing  Another special place for dinner is Somorrostro in Barceloneta, a real find down a small street you wouldn\\'t usually come across, the food is exceptional My boyfriend and I decided to stay at Hotel Banys Orientals after reading its excellent reviews in Frommer\\'s and Lonely Planet travel guides  This fantastic hotel is located just off of a main street in one of the best parts of Barcelona  It is surrounded by great restaurants and a quick walk to many tourist attractions and the stops on the hop-on-hop-off bus tours  The rooms were on the smaller side, but very comfortable and very clean  We asked for a front facing room and enjoyed the birds-eye view of the street and the breeze at night  The staff were friendly and helpful; check in and check out were a breeze  I researched tons of hotels in Barcelona before booking this one, and for the cost (we paid $97 50E per night), there was not a better hotel than this one! I highly recommend this hotel!My husband and I intended to stay in this hotel for 5 nights  We booked the suite to be able to spend some nice comfortable time during our stay  The hotel for us was a complete disappointment: - The suite is far from the main hotel  - Very loud, even with all windows closed, we could still hear every little noise from the street  (not even mentioning the loud motorbikes and constructions) - The lighting is poor  (very dark and not practicable) - TV is small, very far away from the bed and only provides local stations  Besides the facts above, the bathroom was the main problem for me  The water got cold after 10 min shower  The shower cabin is half open, so a lot of water ended up outside, from this not only the wooden frame of the cabin has suffered and went bad, but also it appears that from earlier showers the wooden floor of the suite itself has suffered  We reported this problem to the front desk at the first afternoon we arrived  They confirmed to check  The other morning we informed them again, they said it was already fixed  BUT again, the same thing happened, I stood in shower with cold water  We asked for solution or another room, which was not possible as the hotel was fully booked  At the moment we were already exhausted of discussion, we said we\\'d like to check out  During packing for leaving, they called us again and said they would like to send a professional technician to fix it and also would offer us some discount while staying here  Nevertheless, they did not confirm a specific discount and the attitude of one staff on the phone was incredibly unfriendly and impatient so we finally decided to leave  While doing check-out at the front desk, the unfriendly staff did not apology but insisted on being right and told us hotel rooms with problems were normal  Also he kept complaining about us in Spanish  My husband was very unpleased and we had to waste one full day with discussion, checking out, finding a new hotel and being angry with a bad choice we made  Anyway the bedroom of the suite was big, with a comfortable bed  The hotel offers Free internet ( but slow and no wi-fi), free water and three free apples  Some of the staffs were very supportive and helpful with the problems, but a bad unprofessional staff made this hotel the worst place we\\'ve stayed so far We have just returned from a very pleasant trip to Barcelona, city of Gaudi  The three of us agree with the positive reviews about this hotel  We were very happy here: the rooms are very nice indeed, location cannot be better, hotel amenities excellent, including the free water and apples at each floor, excellent european breakfast buffet, cleanliness, reception staff very helpfull and friendly  The location in the Barri Gotic is excellent: the major sights are all within easy walking distance: Barceloneta, Modernista buildings on the Passeig de Gracia, the Rambla, Palau de la Musica  For the Sagrada Familia church you need to get a subway train or bus  The subway station is right next door  Very handy  The Born district of Barcelona has many tapas bars and restaurants and many (upmarket) boutiques  Overall a nice and safe place to stay  However, if you are planning to wake up later than 7 30 in the morning this is probably not the place for you  Every morning around this time construction work starts in neighboring buildings  Likewise: if you sleep light, be advised: from 11 till 2 at night empty wine bottles are thrown by the bucket load into dumpsters  It is fair to say this goes with the territory, as this is a district with bars and restaurants open till late at night  It did not bother us that much: we stayed from sunday night till thursday, only sunday night was very noisy  We always get up early, so we were not bothered with all the construction work going on  As to the tapas bars in the same street as the hotel: we liked the Tapas bar La taberna del Cobre a lot: good food, nice, efficient service and a very reasonable price  We were very unhappy with the Taller de Tapas bar (also on the same street as the hotel) : when we were getting ready to order our food and drinks, we wanted to order three glasses of wine  The waiter tried to talk us into buying a bottle which was not what we wanted, and a lot more expensive than the price in neighboring bars and tapas restaurants  He was very obnoxious and insisted that a bottle would be our best buy  His cheapest offer was 4,80 euro per glass  As we prepared to leave, he suddenly discovered the housewine that was 2,80 per glass  By now however, we were angry and so put off by this obvious attempt at ripping us off, that we got up and left - and went next door, to the Cobre tapas bar for the second time, where we were given a free drink after our dinner! We don\\'t know what the quality of the food at the Taller is, but we DO KNOW that we don\\'t like to be treated like this  This restaurant was always very busy, so probably the food is okay, but its probably wise to be alert and don\\'t be railroaded into ordering things you really don\\'t need or want  We had great food and wine in all tapas bars in the area  Barcelona is a great city to visit and the Banys is without doubt excellent value for money this was one of the loveliest hotels i have stayed in and as a musician i have stayed in may lovely hotels! the suite - which was the only thing left to book - was a loft in an old palace, three doors down on the main street ( i do not understand previous reviewers here   ) with a central staircase  it was my painter husbands fiftieth birthday and i was a little nervous, but the ceiling height, the huge bed, floor to cieling windows, the private entrance and the tasteful modern city vibe combined with the beams and windows of an ancient building were just perfect  my husband even managed to do a painting! i could have little niggles - wish there had been a bath, tiny showerhead in massive tiled shower cubicle   staff perhaps a little overworked, but we are none of us perfect! here you are in a great private place in the best area of barcelona for such a reasonable price! i will probably book a room in the hotel next just to save on expenses, but this was a worthwhile treat i highly recommend Staying in Barcelona was not for sight seeing or vacation on this occasion  I chose a suite as I wanted additional space for luggage etc and to be able to sit and relax whilst sorting out my forthcoming travel plans etc  The suites turned out to be located in an apartment building down a narrow alley distanced some way from the main hotel  There were some homeless people and stray dogs around and I did not feel very safe walking at night back to the room  The suite itself was over-looked by opposite apartments which meant one had to keep the curtains drawn all of the time  The sitting area (an uncomforatble settee/bed) of the bedroom was divorced from viewing the TV and had very poor lighting  If you understand Spainish then you will OK to watch TV  The hotel receptionist said that the TV\\'s in the suites could not have the language changed on the TV set  In fact the reception on the TV was pretty poor anyway - I guess it was due to the alley way location  To view the TV required one to sit on the bed as there were no armchairs - only one upright chair at the desk location  Free internet access in the room was an appealing asset of the hotel advertised facilities Yet at the desk area there was no telephone point so it was necessary to sit on the bed where the telephone point was located under the bedside table  So it was not comfortable to work at ones\\' laptop siting on the bed  Three of the lights were not working in the room and had to be replaced  So in other words housekeeping had not really checked out the room  Whilst there was free water in the refrigerator, two of the botles had been opened and partially used! Another housekeeping failure  As the room was away from the hotel it would have been nice if coffee making facilites had been included in this room price  We used the dining rooom in the evening and whilst it seemingly has a good reputation, the meal was not exceptional as we had hoped  The femail receptionists on the arrival afternoon were very friendly and helpful as they could be which could not be said of their male counterparts the following morning  No smiles greeted you and they behaved as they were doing you a favour  I politley reminded the hotel of some of the inadequacies of the room and things that still needed to be addressed before there were new room occupants  I also suggested that it would be helpful to have an actual clock in the room  The receptionist pointed to my wristwatch and asked why I could not use that instead  I guess he thought it would be fine to sit up in the night and turn on the dim (low voltage) provided light bulb to see what the time was; remember there was inadequate lighting in the room and due to being over-looked no natural daylight either  So an illuminated clock would be of distinct help to any future user  So I guess if I am being asked what did I think of the hotel ,,, then I would say \"Disappointed\"  I certainly would not recommend using a suite until you have checked that all of the above have been considered and dealt with by the owners We really enjoyed our stay in the suites at the Banys Oriental  The suite we had was spacious, quiet and clean  The bathroom was excellent as were the beds  The room amenities (free water, great bathroom kits) were excellent  Admittedly we knew that the suites were not connected to the hotel otherwise that would have been a bit of a problem for us as it appears to have been for other reviewers  You do feel a bit disconnected to the hotel however the advantage is you get to enjoy a hotel style apartment in a quieter area of El Born  We would most definitely return however might try the rooms in the main hotel next time We stayed in the hotel for a family wedding taking place nearby and it was ideal because of the location  Located centrally in the centre everything is on hand  The area El Born district is really nice with lots of lovely tapas bars within a stones throw away  Very close to the marina and beach too  Nearby is a cafe / bistro called Milkat 21 Gignas (www milkbarcelona com) which is great for brunch If you come out of the hotel and turn left I\\'d recommend the tapas bars there (eaten in them several times) and a bit further up take a right and there is a bar called La Luna which is a good place to visit  I would make one note of warning, this is a touristy area and late at night the atmosphere changes (after the tapas bars shut)-don\\'t go walking around on your own as there are a lot of unfriendly characters about  Also beware of carrying too many valuables with you  We enjoyed sitting out in the tapas bars on the friday night around midnight but the next evening we were still out post wedding at 1 / 2 am ish and it was quite a different story The hotel The staff were all really friendly and helpful during our stay and couldn\\'t have done more for us  The rooms were nice but very modern  This was fine for us but if you don\\'t like chic modern this isn\\'t the place for you  The suits are of a generous size and located in a building a couple of doors down (something to be aware of if you have children)  Our room was very spacious but some of the other family members rooms were not as big  The beds are the same size in all the rooms (very large about 6ft) which is great but the size of the bathroom varies and not all have baths  However this wasn\\'t a problem for us as we didn\\'t want to spend much time in the room  If your room doesn\\'t have a fridge then there are some located in the hallways with free still and sparkling water which is really handy and a nice touch  I\\'ve been to Barcelona several times and would highly recommend it as a city to visit  Its easy to get around, there is lots to do and see and its a vibrant place  Agua on the beach front, near the Port Olympia, by Hotel Arts is a lovely restaurant (booking recommended)  In a nutshell Excellent value, I\\'d stay again  Nicely designed hotel in the Born district, in the old town  Get\\xe2\\x80\\x99s booked up quicklyI wanted to love the Hotel Banys Oriental because it got such great reviews here on Tripadvisor BUT my stay was almost a complete disaster  The desk staff is not knowledgeable about the city, beyond sending you to the sightseeing bus and directing you towards La Rambla  Everything else is as though they lived elsewhere  It\\'s very true that the hotel is centrally located and that is by far the best thing one can say about it  The room we had was small with only a small kitchen type chair to sit on if you used the other one chair to open your luggage on  This is totally forgivable in my mind but my wife has a back issue and found the room very uncomfortable  The worst and most grevious offense was that we had a 6:30 AM flight and wanted a taxi for 5:00 Am so we requested a wake-up call for 4:15 AM The desk called at 5:00 when the cab driver got there and reminded them he was to carry us to the airport  It was a miracle we made it or our connections, hotel and plans for the rest of our trip would have been spoiled, not to mention we would have had to stay in Banys another night when they were admittedly completely booked  TGreat location, really nice, clean rooms for under 100 euro per night for a double room   what more can you ask for? I recommend this hotel to everyone I know, it\\'s such a good place to stay for a weekend in barcelona  I will be staying there later this year again Having had a really bad experience staying in a prison-like hostel for our first couple of days in Barcelona, myself and my friend were looking for somewhere we would feel welcome and where we could relax after a hard day\\'s touristing/partying! The Hotel Banys Oriental fulfilled all our needs, ticking all the boxes and more!! We were allocated one of the suites in the annexed building  We had reservations about being based away from the main hotel at first but these were unfounded  We were delighted with our chic, well-designed spacious suite with a balcony overlooking the pedestrianised street below us, and a mezzanine with comfy sofa  The decor was modern yet understated and elements of the original Gothic architecture had been retained which made this a unique hotel experience  I think what made our stay in the Hotel Banys so good was the fact that we were made to feel like we were being looked-after which was in stark contrast to our stay at the Hostal Fontanella just a short distance away (see my review under the title Control Freaks!)  ALL the staff were SUPER helpful and friendly and were more than willing to make our stay the best it could possibly be  We thought the cost of the suite at 135euros was great value for the standard of decor and service we received  The added extras of free water in the fridge, a bowl of fruit and free internet access were just some of the details that made our stay in the Hotel Banys a memorable one  I\\'ve been telling all my friends about this gem of a boutique hotel!! GO THERE!!We stayed here at the recommendation of friends  For the price, you definitely cannot beat it, especially given that you are right in the middle of El Born, but it really is not all that (contrary to the glossy recommendation in the Phaidon Wallpaper Guide)  The staff wasn\\'t all that friendly - it was almost as if they were doing us a favor by answering our questions or helping us out - and the accomdations are just really basic  I just have a problem with two twin beds being put together and having it be called a double  Also, the black-tiled bathrooms had some sort of paper on them for \"effect\" and that was peeling on the shower floor - not exactly the most hygenic, to be honest  Worst of all, there was this blaring construction going on right outside of our window, which made siesta and sleeping in a bit of a challenge  If you just want a place to sleep, dump your stuff and shower this place is suitable, but if you want to pace yourself I would find another place to stay We were three friends that stayed in one of the suites  Starting off    the location was very nice  Five minutes from the harbour with great restaurants and sights, ten minutes from Ramblas and a couple of blocks from the Jaume I metro station  The staff was very friendly and helpful  We tried the breakfast one morning and it was a good buff\\xc3\\xa9 with lots to chose from, though I was missing a real good cafe con leche  We didn\\'t try the restaurant for dinner, so I can\\'t comment on that  As I said, we stayed in one of the suites  Ours was located in another building about 150 meters away  It was very spacious and stylishly decorated  Fruit and water were provided free of charge    love that! If things like room service and on hand staff are important to you, then the suites might not be what you want  But we are quite independent travellers and liked being on our own exploring the city using the room only for sleeping  And the price can\\'t be beaten    130 euros(+ 40 for extra bed) per night! I have been to Barcelona several times and had seen all of the major sights    so this time I did a day trip to the Montserrat monastery  It was wonderful    I highly recommend the trip!The Banys Oriental is in the (old town) Ribera district of Barcelona and is very handy for the Picasso Museum and the other museums that occupy that street  It is also easy walking distance from the Ramblas  The hotel is not huge and is a refurbished old building decorated in a cool, calm and modern style with a confident touch  The room we had was a double and was adequately-sized but maybe just a touch on the cramped side to get round due to the large size of the beds  There is one small elevator serving all guest on all floors, so sometimes it can take a while to reach you  Nice touches were the big glass refrigerators on every floor, stocked with (free) chilled bottles of water, alongside big bowls of fruit  The attached restaurant is very good indeed and is popular and has a good reputation with non-guests as well  The big attraction of this hotel for me was the location on a traffic-free street in the heart of Ribera which meant that most places we wanted to go were within walking distance, Also, everything worked and it was calm, comfortable and stress-free  Would I go again?     yes, very probably I have stayed there for 3 nights Our Stay was very pleasant The staff was very friendly including roomcleaningladies and technical staff The ambiance was very relaxed en warm  The street was very cosie and authentic old  Nice shops and restaurants and a nice church end of the street, sundayevening mas open for everyone!!!Go there!!!10 minutes walk to beach and ramblas !!!!Nice beach barceloneta !About the hotel again,Very helpful receptionist ,and extreemly friendly  Nice rooms and spotless And FREE COOL WATER at the corridor in fridge for guests   box with shampoo brush soap toothbrush toothpaste lotion slippers ect ect    Nice plasma tv with good channels   I woud go there again for sure !!!!!!Nothing negative about this hotel I had high expectations of this after finding it in Style Europe  But to be honest was very average  The reception staff didn\\'t exactly start off very well  When I arrived I had to leave my car badly parked and I asked the man at reception if someone could take my bag to my room while I parked my car  He told me I could take it myself! The room was OK , not very inspiring but adequate  The following morning I had to leave the hotel at 815 to catch my flight and was informed breakfast doesn\\'t start till 8 30 which I thought was late for a saturday  Not even a cup of tea was available  I wouldn\\'t rush back Stayed at shis hotel for 3 nights Very nice helpfull staf and very friendly  Very clean room and big shower nice airco and plasma tv   safe in the room and bottles of drinkwater in de corridor for guests for free!!!!! I will come here again for sure   Location perfect 10 minutes walk to beach barcelonetta and 10 minutes walk to ramblas Very nice church santa maria in street at sundayevening nice mas en impressing church if you like you can go there I wiil recommend this hotel to everyone who wants a mix of old barcelona in a modern ambiance with lots of eating places bars shops and culture with the picasso museum on the corner !!!!!Very relaxed ambiance  We\\'ve just got back from the Banys Orientals, having booked following reviews we had read on this site  We booked direct by e-mail, and they were very efficient and answered questions promptly in English  We felt that the room price was excellent value  We caught the bus to Barcelona from Girona Airport with no trouble, and because it was very hot when we arrived at the bus station we decided against carrying luggage up and down stairs on the metro and caught a taxi instead - 15 minutes in heavy traffic, \\xe2\\x82\\xac8, not bad, and a friendly lady driver who dropped us off at the corner  We travelled around the city by metro on one day, using a ten journey ticket between the two of us, and found it easy, and the rest of the time we walked slowly because of the heat, and with a prolonged lunch somewhere, and a siesta back at the cool hotel that worked fine  Our second floor room was very stylish, especially the bathroom, but it was quite tight to get around the bed, and there was a huge wardrobe but no drawer space or hooks to keep things tidy  However, who cares, for three days? The wardrobe safe, air conditioning and free iced water and internet were all very much appreciated, and the bed was wonderful  We looked out at the back of the hotel on to a quiet area  The staff in reception were unfailingly helpful and courteous, those in the restaurant were less smiley, but did the necessary  We were using both English and Spanish and felt that their knowledge of both might have been less confident than the reception staff  We ate one dinner and all our breakfasts in the hotel, and they were all delicious and very good value, especially the breakfasts if you can eat lots from a buffet in the morning, easy to fill up and then you don\\'t need much later  If you don\\'t want to eat much for breakfast, it\\'s probably cheaper to go elsewhere, like right next door to the hotel  We also had some lovely lunches and dinners in the bars and restaurants round the city, and can recommend the Taller de Tapas and the Taberna del Cobre in the same street as the hotel  We didn\\'t know Barcelona, and three days was a good introduction, one for the historic central part, one for the port and beach area, and one for the Gaud\\xc3\\xad trail  Try the chocolate museum not far from the hotel! With ordinary city street awareness and common sense about what to carry when and where, we felt quite safe everywhere at all times  We shall go back for the rest of the sights at a slightly cooler time of year!We were recommended this hotel by a friend and booked through the hotel directly  The hotel is in an ideal location and within walking distance of the beach and La Rambla and Placa Catalanya where we caught the Bus Touristic  The welcome pack in the bathroom of the hotel is a nice touch, as are the complimentary bottles of water on each floor which you can help yourself to each day  It is a little noisy and the bathroom is like a sauna however these 2 negatives are totally outweighed by the location, clean and comfortable rooms which are well decorated and furnished, complimentary water, welcome pack, free internet access and directly above a superb restaurant (Senyor Parellada)  The Santa Maria church and square are a stone\\'s throw from the hotel  The square has a good wine bar called La Vinya del Senyor where you can sit outside in the square and watch the world go by with a glass or bottle of whatever your heart desires from a huge wine list  There are small restaurants and a bar (Buba) next door which are all worth a visit  If you walk round from the square in the direction of the zoo you\\'ll find a boulevard which comes alive after 11pm with local bars - well worth a visit if you like to keep away from the tourist bars  Avoid the acclaimed restaurant called Los Caracoles - we had a terrible meal there which was very expensive  The paella was inedible and the bread rolls were stale  It was such a disappointment after having queued for a table  On a different night we also queued for La Fonda which is just a long the street from Los Caracoles  The meal was excellent and really good value for money - well worth queuing for  Sightseeing Tips: Casa Batllo is well worth a visit if you like to do something different indoors  Avoid the Vasquez part of the Picasso Museum as it is mind numbinging rubbish  Make a visit to Park Guell as a stop on the Bus Touristic route  Don\\'t pay to enter the Sagrada Familia  The inside of the beautiful cathedral is literally a building site with nothing to see other than a queue of people waiting 90 minutes to get the lift to the top of one of the spires  The outside is breathtaking  The view from Park Guell is free and is just as lovely  The boating lake in the park next to the zoo is a good place to sit and soak up the sun Just lovely  In a great part of town - the thing is in Barcelona, I don\\'t think you want to be TOO central- Las Ramblas is hideous  However, this old town bit, quite near the beach and public transport is delightful  Nice, small, chic rooms  **Awesome** restaurant downstairs, lots of fun  Good staff, nothing bothered me about it at all We stayed at this hotel in July 2008  Contrary to some reviews I\\'ve read here our standard double room was not small  Granted the bed was enormous, but I found that rather charming  The hotel was very clean and modern and the service was great  I didn\\'t quite like the black! shower, but I guess that\\'s just a matter of taste  We had a room overlooking a quiet side street and we had no trouble with traffic or noise  Guests had free access to two computers on the second floor and there was complimentary water bottles for guests on every floor, very nice in the heat of July  The location of this hotel is superb  A short walk from La Ramblas, one metro stop from Barceloneta(the metro station right outside the hotel) and a number of charming botiques on every corner  But my number one selling argument would be the price  99 euros a night  Trust me, that\\'s a reasonable price for a hotel like this Stayed at hotel for three nights in June 2008  The hotel offered outstanding value for money and was in the ideal location close to great restaurants and bars  The decor is quite chic and the free internet and water was a nice bonus  Plus, it is a short walk from the waterfront and only a couple minutes from the subway  We ate at the Senyor Paradella in the hotel, which was excellent also and had a great deal of charm  I would definately recommend this hotel, without hesitating  Ensure you book well in advance though, as we booked four three months prior and still didn\\'t get all the dates we had hoped Banys is a good choice for so many things--location, price, cleanliness, etc  The rooms are spare but stylish and comfortable  Another nice touch is that they supply free bottled water and fruit  There is no need to pay extra for the breakfast  There are cafes on either side of the hotel where you can get a good breakfast for a fraction of the price  We were a party of seven, with four rooms  After one night we decided to switch rooms--my aunt and uncle were going to move into our room and my husband and I were moving to a different room  This was okayed by the front desk  Someone told us the room number we\\'d be moving to and that we could move our luggage there  It was still being cleaned, but the maid let us bring the luggage in  My aunt and uncle brought their luggage to our old room  While my husband was down the street somewhere, I was waiting in the hall for the room to be ready, which was just supposed to take a couple more minutes  Then I heard angry footsteps approaching from the elevator  It was another guy from the front desk who was in a fury because we had already put our luggage in the room  He yelled at me in Spanish and broken English (including the word \"stupido\") and then stormed off to shout at my aunt, who was waiting in the lobby  He was angry because we had moved our luggage into the rooms before they were ready  My husband, who is fluent in Spanish, talked to him afterward and told him he had overreacted and that he shouldn\\'t have yelled at us, that we had been told we could move the luggage  He gave my husband a grudging, ungracious apology  A couple of days later my uncle observed him yelling at another hotel guest in the lobby  We all wondered why this person chose a career in the customer service industry Great location in regards to being able to walk eveywhere  If you are driving, insist on the hotel sending you instructions/map on where to park- its all one way streets or inaccessible streets and you will spend a lot of time trying to figure out the jumble of old streets just to get to the hotel  Took way too long to find in a car   For the price, the rooms are nice, a bit on the small side  No room service or mini bar and no bathtub, but nice furniture and bath kits in the room  Staff a bit inconsistent- some nice, some not so  Free internet was nice  Clean and modern, hard to find a better deal for the price Banys Orientals was a chic, clean, and perfectly situated  A great value for a very good hotel  Hotel: Clean, simple and chic, nice little LCD tv in the room, great balcony views of the street action  The staff was friendly, the art in the room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the air conditioning unit in the room was fairly good but might be a concern if it would have been hot  Bathroom was nice enough, but didn\\'t have very good water pressure in the shower to really make showering very enjoyable  We thought it was a good balance of modern and comfortable  Location: Right on Calle Argenteria which runs right through the La Ribera district (also known as the Born district)  There was a lot of action right in front of and around the hotel  At the same time, it wasn\\'t very noisy at all  The Born district is so full of life, and art/fashion is what this area is about  Plus some great restaurants, pastelerias, and shops within a few steps of the hotel  Additional Benefits: Free water bottles in the mini refrigerator on each floor  Two computers with free internet access This is a nice small hotel with one of the best locations in Barcelona  You can literally throw a ball from the hotel and hit the metro station and the Borne area is very nice and full of lively bars and restaurants  The hotel itself is nice and clean  The service is very simple  Do not expect much  I would suggest bringing earplugs because the walls are thin and it\\'s very noisy outside  The hotel is often full and hard to book but it\\'s worth trying because the price is excellent  The restaurant next store called Senyor Parrellada is really good   fresh, good tasting, resonably priced food in a nice atmoshphere   can\\'t ask for more in a restaurant!Stayed here May 24-26th, and i cant believe how inexpensive it is compared to everything else around  It is about a 5 minute walk to the Barcelona Cathedral, Picasso Musuem, or Las Ramblas  So its right in the middle of everything, The hotel lobby is on a fairly busy street/walkway with lots of shops and vendors everywhere  We stayed in a suite which is not conected to the lobby  It is about a 2 minute walk down the street next to Santa Maria Del Mar Cathedral  The suites are in an apartment bulding and the only bad thing is that there is no door man  I felt safe walking home at 3am, but i could see that some people might not  as it is down an alley a few steps The good thing about the suites, is that they are not on the main walkway, so they are pretty quit  The suites were huge with 2 rooms and a good size bathroom  The rooms came with a fridge and free water and fruit  They had no english TV stations however  The rooms had hardware floors and you are provided slippers, and the rooms are decorated very nice and simple  If this hotel made the lobby a little fancier, and maybe put a doorman at the suite building, it could easily charge 2x as much which is what all teh other hotels in the area charge This is a beautiful hotel located on a great little street in the center of Barcelona  If you enjoy convenience and value for money with a touch of design, this is the hotel for you! I won\\'t repeat what the previous reviewer said about all the amenities (all true), but I will comment about the noise level  The hotel was EXTREMELY noisy, both from within the hotel and from the outside street  Sources of noise from within the hotel: the wooden floors, the lift (strangely loud) and the hotel\\'s decision to start working on the plumbing at 8am  Sources of noise from outside the hotel: street cleaning trucks, revelers and drunks, and the single windows unfortunately did not guard us whatsoever  Honestly, i cannot understand anyone NOT being disturbed by the noise  Over breakfast we chatted with other guests who experienced the exact same thing even though their room was on the other side of the hotel  Oh, speaking of breakfast, SKIP IT  The selection looked old and unfresh  There are many options just outside the hotel and much more delicious  In conclusion, I would stay here again, but this time I\\'m going to bring ear plugs  Hopefully that will solve the problem We stayed 3 nights in this hotel in El Born on 20April to 23 april  The hotel looks v chic and matches what is shown on the website  The room is not v big but we love what is provided  We have unlimited supply of water (still as well as sparkling) at a fridge by the lift, 2 computer terminals with free internet access, amenty kit with comb, hairbrush, sanitary napkin, a bathing sponge, shampoo, bath gel and body lotion  There is also a manifying mirror in the toilet  There are english channels like CNN and BBC which is good for the non-spanish speaking like us  The restaurant which belongs to the hotel serves fantastic food! Before arriving at the hotel, i was quite worried after reading so much comments about the noise  while it is true that the el born area is bustling at night, our room was really quiet as it does not face the street  So if u want some peace and quiet, request for one with the hotel  Only thing i don\\'t like so much is that the toilet is a little dark at night with only the ambient lighting illuminating the toilet  We love the place and will definitely recommend it to out friends The hotel is really in a superb location! It is located in the Born Area, in a pedestrian street, 1 minute walking from the metro station  We loved the neighbourhood which was very lively and full of bars and restaurants! Now about the hotel itself    - We\\'ve stayed in a room (not suite) in the 4th floor and it was very small indeed! Also we have asked for a quiet room so they gave us one on the side street which was  \\'adequately\\' quiet!! (sometimes you could still hear some noise though but not a big deal   ) - The bathroom was lovely but the power of the shower was not very good  - They have refrigerators with free bottles of water on every floor which was very nice  - They have two computers that you can use for free, or if you have your own laptop they give you a cable and you have free internet in the room! (big plus for us!) Overall our feeling of the hotel is really positive! I would definitely recommend it to friends because it\\'s in the most amazing location (for me the best), nice decor and even though the rooms are small, but i think it is a great value for money hotel in Barcelona (100\\xe2\\x82\\xac/night),My wife and I spent 4 nights the end of March  We stayed in one of the suites  The suite was very large and quiet  We enjoyed the space and the free water provided by the hotel in our refrigerator  The location could not have been better  We could walk everywhere  The hotel staff was extremely helpful  They could not do enough for us  The hotel even provided 2 computers for free internet service  The restaurant in the hotel was excellent and not pricey  We did not eat breakfast in the hotel since there were many options nearby  We highly recommend this hotel We have just returned from 5 days in Barcelona  The hotel was great, staff were friendly and kept in communication right up to the departure date  Rooms were fairly large, bright and clean  Bathroom was large and well equipped but did lack any kind of ventilation so took a while for steam to clear after a shower  All guests can have free bottled water and fruit which are placed on the landings  Hotel location quite central so not far to restaurants  Easy to get to from airport via bus and a 15 mins walk, you can get a metro to the end of the street if you don\\'t like the walk  If arriving late would suggest taxi as tourists seem to get targeted by pickpockets  Recommendations for where to eat would be Les Quinze Nits in Placa Reial, you have to queue but food is good and fairly cheap  For the best ice cream I have ever had there is Gelaaati on C/Llibreteria next to Jaume I metro station The hotel has really good location  I could not sleep during the night due to terrible noises  fromthe street (it seemed that window was open) and the noise fromthe room close to you   i could listen all the things that the man close to my roomwas saying The decoration is nice    It was amazing that bed was without blanket  and we are in the winter   Some staff are really nice and another are quite unrude   but I think that the management should follow up this matter, specially with the south american lady  from the breakfast   really bad bad manners   it seemed that she was annoying to give you the breakfast  Summarize  really good location, it is nice   but the problem is the noise and not professional staff This hotel has character and is in an excellent location  The restaurant is very good - reasonable prices, huge menu, very popular  Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife\\'s purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned  Obviously we shouldn\\'t have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street  Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room  The hotel (and cleaner) were no doubt banking (correctly) that we wouldn\\'t bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station!The location is great  We were very excited to get a room here based on press and photos (and price)  The place is very chic but the noise level in the room ruined everything  The shower was also smelly (mildew) which made the room smell, and the tile had been painted over! Our room was 3rd floor above the alley outside the restaurant kitchen so after the kitchen noise finally died down, the motorbikes started up  This is a common thing in Barcelona, becuase of the late nights and small alleys, unless you can find a hotel w/ dual glazed / modern windows  We switched to the Grand Hotel Centrale down the street and loved it  At that point I would have paid anything for a good nights sleep Stayed here for 3 nights just before Christmas, loved the central location on a pedestrianised street in El Born with lots of tapas and bars nearby, also 1minute from Metro Jaume  Rooms are a little small but partly due to massive four-poster bed which was so comfy we slept 12 hours on first night  Good bathroom with walk-in shower and separate toilet  Also tucked in to buffet breakfast, standard fare but good value for 10 euro  Best hotel I\\'ve stayed at in Barcelona - 98 euro for a double,a bargain tooThis was a lovely hotel  great location, within walking distance to most of the major sights and close to an underground line  we stayed in one of the suites, very large, modern, airy room  staff very helpful  would definitely recommend!This hotel is the absolute best location in Barcelona!! It made our trip because of where we were  We could walk to everything--there were great restaurants around, great tapas bars, a beautiful old cathedral, and nightclubs  We did have to change rooms after the first night though because of the noise  We could literally hear the couple next door have all of their conversations  You can also hear everyone walking around the hallways  But, if you can get a room where you just hear the people walking by and not your neighbor, you\\'ll have a great experience  The bathrooms were modern and clean  Definitely recommended!A group of nine stayed at the Banys Oriental for a four night stay  Our journey couldn\\'t have begun more badly! A five hour flight delay meant that we eventually arrived at the hotel at 3am  This is where it began to go well  We were greeted by a very welcoming young man, who booked us all in with great charm and a warm welcome for such a late hour  The rooms are individually designed to fit the space available in an oldish building  This said they are very smart, with all the features that you could wish  Not large, but big enough for a stay of our length  The shower in our room was spectacular! Breakfast is an extra but well worth it  A huge array of cold meats, boiled eggs, spanish omelette, cereals and enough pastries to keep you going all day  The attached restaurant serves Catalan food to a high standard but you will need to book - we got in our our last night  If we go back to Barcelona, and I do hope we will, we will definitely stay at the Banys Oriental Excellent place, great staff, good food, good location - complimentary water excellent touch                    will definately be back!This hotel was recommended to me- and i can not recommend it more highly to you! It is an amazing city, and this is an absolute gem of a hotel- we actually stayed at the adjoining apartments  Only \\xe2\\x82\\xac125 per night!! Gorgeous, clean, complimentary fruit/water in your own fridge!! Small mezzanine floor with small sofa/ bed- just cool for a chill out! Two small balconys- only enough room to stand out on- with amazing, if a bit restricted, views  Bed is two twins alongside, encased in a four poster frame  Very comfy- didn\\'t mind the twins at all  BAthrooms were kitted out better than some 5 stars I\\'ve stayed in! Complimentary everything  We lost our lauggage, and the hotel even supplied a toothbrush- and they didn\\'t know- it is a complimentary service, And a great touch  Absolutely central, and absolutely chic  Gorgeous Tapas Bar downstairs- reasonable and friendly  Fav roaming places were Gothis quarter and the Plaza Real- just around the corner- towards Las Ramblas  There\\'s a wee street at the top of L\\'Argentaria, if you turn right and walk 200 metres (if even) there\\'s a lovely little supermarket for water or wine!! I had emailed the staff in advance, and always got a prompt and friendly reply, no matter what the request  Absolute pleasure to stay here- could only be bettered if they were to introduce pool/ sauna etc    Go- and you will love it!I found Bany\\'s to be a contemporary hotel in a great area  Close to Las Ramblas, the Picasso museum and several very interesting Barcelona icons  It may not be the place for travelers who like a lot of peace and quite but if you\\'re looking to enjoy the city and be in walking distance of most things, then it\\'s the place for you! We booked several suites along with doubles  The locations of the suites are a good little ways from the main facility but were safe and comfortable  We\\'ll return here again and encourage others to do the same  It\\'s a great deal for the $$$$$  The staff was helpful The Banys Oriental Hotel was, for central Barcelona, very reasonably priced  For this price range, I thought the hotel was wonderful  The location is great - within walking distance of the Cathedral, the Santa Maria del Mar, the harbor, the Ramblas, and great shopping  Metro and bus are also close by  I would note that the street noise can be a bit loud at night (particularly since locals keep later hours than the average Brit, American or German)  This did not bother me at all, but I can see that if you were a light sleeper, you might find the level of activity at 1 a m  to be bothersome  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful  The restaurant next door had good food and I would recommend making a reservation for dinner there  The breakfast was expensive (10 Euro per day), but the variety of items was excellent  We only had breakfast in the hotel twice and of course, it was a European breakfast ( a lot of different rolls, breads, croissants), cheeses, meats, cereals, soft boiled eggs, and fruit  There were a lot of options and the quality was good  If you just want coffee and a croissant or a panini, I would recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and heading out to a local cafe (considerably less expensive)  The hotel also has computers that you can use on the second floor to check your e-mail or surf the Web  This is free of charge and I found it to be a nice service in terms of checking in with home  The rooms themselves are very nice    contemporary design and very clean  The hotel provides slippers, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, a hairbrush, comb, sponge, toothbrush, showercap, etc  to guests  This was a nice perk  For this class of hotel, I really only expected soap and perhaps shampoo, so I was pleasantly surprised at all the other toiletries  The bathroom was also nice, if small  The only thing that I really didn\\'t like about the room was that the bathroom had no ventilation   fan or otherwise  As a result, there was always a lingering mildew smell in the bathroom  Finally, the hotel provided a refrigerator full of bottled water, available to guests on the floor  I thought this was a very nice amenity, given that restaurants and shops will charge you 1 or 2 Euros for the same bottle of water  In short, if you want to be in the center of the action and you want good value for your money, this hotel comes highly recommended Having never been to Barcelona before, I have no basis of comparison to other properties in Barcelona  That said, the location was perfect  In the heart of EVERYTHING, and we could be just about anywhere we wanted within a short 5-10 minute walk  To have that kind of central location without all of the crazy noise, was a plus  The hotel was reasonably priced  The rooms were really not well designed  They had nice furniture, linens and such, but they were not well laid-out  For example, we were in a King-Bed room  The Four-Poster Bed took up over 95% of the room  We literally spent our time negotiaing the 1 meter perimeter of the room AROUND the bed  The closet was unacceptably small and there was no chest of drawers so we were living out of our suitcases  Also, there was no room for the suitcases, so we piled them up around the bed, making it even harder to move around  The bathroom was nice and clean, but there was no ventilation and it had a musty smell  Frankly, for a \"boutique\" hotel in Europe, I was hoping for something a bit more elegant and with the basics- room to put our suitcases, hang up clothes, and a room which could be navigated without having to step over and around (or side-step) the furniture  Very disappointing experience Was recommended this hotel by a friend who lives in Barcelona, and what a find    GREAT location, right in the heart of the gothic quarter, very close to Barcelonetta and the port, and so easy to walk to the main shopping street and ramblas    nice decor in the hotel, rooms a little small (although we did have a cot in the room so next time i would book a suite) and although i was a little disappointed there was no bath for my toddler, she really enjoyed the \\'wet room\\' shower  the free water and apples in the coIridoors were a really nice touch - staff were very friendly and welcomed our toddler with open arms  All in all, a great experience, great value for money and fab location - would recommend it to anyone after a boutique style hotel, travelling with children, wanting to be in the best area of town - for a great price!This little gem of a hotel in the heart of the the gothic area in Barcelona was a wonderfull choice for our honeymoon  Having never been to Barcelona before, we found it to be perfectly located for many of the main \\'attractions\\' which meant other than a taxi to Parc Guell we walked everywhere  We stayed in a lovely suite, which when booking we were given the impression were around the corner, are actually about 3 mins walk away on a quiet non commercial street, in a building shared with other apartments/suites  Having said that it meant it was extrodinarily quiet for mid city and we felt a little more independent  It was cleaned daily though, including fresh towels & linen, and was very spacious, fab slate tiled bathroom! The buffet breakfast was great, but a bit pricey at 10 euors a head when there is a fab little pastry shop 3 doors up from the main hotel where you can both eat for 7! There are also some wonderful tapas bars on your doorstep, not to mention ice cream shops!!Great location, great price, friendly staff  Barcelona is full of hotels; most are hideously overpriced  The Banys Orientals is a welcome exception to the rule  While not inexpensive, at least you get a sparkling clean room in a wonderful, quiet location  I can\\'t recommend it enough This is the first time I ever bothered to write a review for anything  The hotel is conveniently located across the main street from the Barri Gotic area in a lively side street and close to many other attractions in town  Some reviews complained about the noise level, so we requested for a quieter room in the back and didn\\'t have a problem at all  The Euro went far for this hotel in that the decor in the room is nice, modern, clean and reasonably sized  The hotel also provided free bottled water and fruits  There\\'s also a really tasty tapas bar just down the street called Sagardi  The staff was friendly and helpful  We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and would definitely stay there again in the future We stayed at the Hotel Banys on our honeymoon  It was our first visit to Barcelona, and we found the location to be exactly what we wanted! The staff was helpful in recommending dining options and the free bottled water was a nice perk  Rooms were good size and very clean  We would absolutely stay here on another visit to the city Stayed in one of their suites for four nights  A great location in Barcelona, very reasonable price, and helpful staff The Banys Orientals has many advantages: good location, highly affordable and well-decorated  The huge disadvantage: it\\'s clairaudient  We stayed on the top floor and heard everything from the room besides us: The conversations of an elderly couple (word by word), the zipper of their baggage etc  And, probably most annoying of it all: The sound of the elevator  All night long  We have never stayed in a hotel that clairaudient  If you want to have some peace on your holidays, go somewhere else  If deaf: nice choice!Before booking this hotel, My partner and I and another couple we went with looked at a number of hotels within this price range  All were very basic and below basic from what we could see from photos on websites and so on  All really quite bland until we were reccommended the Hotel Banys Oriental  Really glad we were as its a really really nice hotel particularly when compared to the other hotels we had seen, for the same price!! They had sold out of the normal rooms so we went for Suites They were really good in size and you could tell that the whole hotel had pretty much been newly renovated  Really nice modern quality mixed with a bit of character  The staff were very friendly and helpfull  Free water in the fridge  Brilliantly located Hotel  Close to everything  Lots of little boutique shops for trendy mens and womens clothing  Some lovely restaurents and bars also nearby  The metro just at the end of the street What a location - less than a minute\\'s walk from the Jaume I metro, right in the heart of the Born and surrounded by bars and restaurants - perfect! We were expecting a slightly small room, from previous reviews and this is the case, but to be fair, at 98 Euros per night, you can live with it! The bathroom, whilst stylish was in need of some renovation, with quite significant water damage around the bath - again, you get what you pay for  We loved Barcelona and in particular this area and would definitely return - so many great bars and restaurants, right on your doorstep and all very reasonable  We stayed for 4 nights and would gladly have stayed for longer - you need the time to visit all the amazing sites and architecture  We flew to Girona, where we stayed for 2 nights, then got the train to Barcelona  On our return we got the Bus from Barcelona back to Girona Airport - all incredibly easy and convenient and cheap  A nice touch at the hotel is free mineral water on each of the floors, together with free internet access - quite a plus when considering how reasonable the room rates are  On the downside, there is some street noise outside, mainly commercial bin/bottle collections, although this was only bad on one night I had checked various websites including \"tripadvisor\" before booking this hotel for a long weekend with my wife and another couple  However closer to our departure I got a bit nervous as some of the reviews were not favourable but I decided to stick with our original (and very cheap) booking  I need not have worried  The location (in El Born) is fantastic with so many shops, restaurants and cafes nearby in little sidestreets and squares  The hotel reception is little more than a desk and anyone who wants a grand lobby, bar or even a great buzz from the hotel will be disappointed  However all of these things are provided by the area in spades so the lack of facilities were made up by the rooms  We had booked suites which were a few hundred yards away off the Placa Santa Maria which again had plenty of life both day and night  The rooms were very spacious and well-kept  The decor was modern and minimal without being sparse  They are like small apartments with a shared communal entrance but at @ \\xc2\\xa390 per night they were a bargain  I would have no hesutation staying there again and although some reviews said staff could be surly they booked a restaurant and taxis for us with no difficulty and were very courteous  If you spend a lot of time around your hotel go somewhere else but if you enjoy a little bit of luxury at a knockdown price book it now surly staff, smelly room, noisy, and conned us with the exchange rate and wouldn\\'t respond to my requests for an explanation  Don\\'t go It\\'s a nice and modern hotel  We stayed for four nights  We stayed in the suites which is in a separate building about 5 minutes away from the main location  It gives you a feeling of having your own apartment in Barcelona  Our suite was huge and very classy, cool, and modern  It\\'s surrounded by tine old streets and so you can hear whatever goes on  We stayed on the first floor  This is the metalsmithing area so you can hear some of that  Also, when people talk in the streets, you may be able to hear it  The room was beautiful and airy  TV only had Spanish local channels  Bathroom had a huge shower, but some of the fixtures were coming out of the wall (soap dish) We stayed at the Banys for 3 nights and were very pleased with the hotel  The rooms were not terribly huge, but big enough, and furnished very nicely  Cool, stylish design, a nice view from our 2nd story window to the pedestrian alley below with the Christmas market  Located very close to the old quarter of Barcelona, the hotel is walking distance from so many attractions - we walked down to the harbor, into the old city, all over the place! Breakfast at the hotel did cost extra, but was worth it overall - lots of choices  The free water in the fridge in the hallway was absolutely delicious and a refreshing surprise! Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much and would absolutely stay here again Great location in busy area with lots of bars, great restaurants and shops  We booked a suite and therefore were located in the annexe     a few hundred yards down the street from the main hotel and up a dark quiet street  Perhaps not the best location if you\\'re a lone female traveller  Main hotel would have been nicer for the buzz  Hotel restaurant was lovely though and great value  Suite was large but a bit worn around the ages and would be easy enough to fix  The lift would only take one passenger at a time, bathroom full of scuff marks which a quick lick of paint would easily sort  No English TV apparently if that\\'s a concern to you + Points Location in El Born Complimentary Bottled Water + fruit on each floor Reasonable size room and liked the \"walk in\" shower Restaurant next door offers decent food at a decent prize  Warning very busy ! - Points Internal nosie from stairs, lift, next door - the walls must be thin could hear next door showering  Also street noise, although we were at the side not overlooking the main street, windows are not soundproofed  Staff were ok by and large - not as bad as feared  For the price offers ok value in comparison with similar boutique hotels we have stayed in in Barcelona (Balmes, Granados, Actual)  Would stay again but probably not for light sleepers !I would definetely recommend the hotel  It is in a central very good location near a lot of bars and restaurantes in the middle of the old city  The hotel is stylish and clean  Rooms are small but nice  Staff was helpful, complications with our booking confirmation were solved by them immediately  So just go for it   you get good value for what you pay!!! Negative are only the thin walls, sometimes it was a bit noisy    but therefore you are in the center of town We stayed in 5 rooms for a week end early this month  I do not recommend it to others  Good: Location The appealing design and decor One nice receptionist and nice housekeeping staff Nice touch having free water and fruit on the floors  Bad: You can hear everything from the room next door (I mean everything, even coughing) No lobby area where you can wait for your friends  The housekeepers do help themselves from the buffets in the restaurant  I think they could have the same items but from the kitchen  Staff in breakfast talk between them as if they were in the back offices of the hotel  (very impolite) Front desk staff not warm at all  Will never come back I spent about 5 nights at Banys Orientals with my boyfriend this past November, 2006, and would not recommend it to others  Despite the great location of this hotel, and the appealing design and decor, we found the staff to be inhospitalble, unhelpful, and at times, rude  We also ate at their restuarant next door, which was the worst meal we had during our entire 8 days in Spain  By the end of our stay, my boyfriend and I had determined that Banys Orientals is badly managed, and while staff blend in with the sex appeal and design sense of the hotel, they lack the warmth and hospitality most of us seek when travelling abroad and exploring a new city  Stay in this neighborhood, but find another hotel!We stayed in this simplistic and modernly decorated hotel in central Barcelona  It was in a great district close to some Tapas bars and restaurants  The staff were very friendly and we couldn\\'t fault anything  There is no room service, but you can help yourself to the free bottled water supplied in a fridge on each floor  I would recommend this hotel I have stayed at this fantastic small hotel several times, by myself, with clients in form of a small group and with friends  Whichever the purpose of my stay, staff has always been helpful and flexible with any kind of demands  They have at all times been going out of their way to ensure great service to my clients  Placing the reservation may need a little patience  But once you\\'re set, you\\'ll be set  Location of the hotel is top  It\\'s located in the center of the most hip area of Barcelona  Surrounded by great tapas bars, hip stores (not the standard shops you find in every city), main attractions are in walking distance, metro station is only a second\\'s walk from the hotel  Breakfast is extensive and very good  The rooms are big enough to enjoy your stay  Bathrooms are large (in comparison to other city hotels in Europe)  Amenities are great  Internet cxn incl  Complementary bottled water in a fridge on each floor  It\\'s a little hideaway in the middle of the city Frankly, if you\\'re sat there reading this review you\\'re wasting time that could be much better spent booking this great little hotel  We had a 2 night stay in one of the suites (all the normal rooms were gone)  The booking service was good, and email confirmation was sent within minutes  On arrival, our bags were carried up to the suite by a very nice bloke and we were left alone in a beautifully cool and spacious room, complete with mezzanine, enormous bed, fridge stacked with complimentary water and balcony overlooking some of Barcelona\\'s best bits  The windows shut tight to block out all but the noisiest of party-ers while blackout curtains ensure an undisturbed night\\'s sleep, meaning your stay is as peaceful and relaxing as it is comfortable  What\\'s so amazing about this place, however, are the prices  Our suite was 125 Euros (about \\xc2\\xa390) per night for two people, which was amazing considering what you get, and the standard rooms are much cheaper  We\\'ll be back again, and reserve a little earlier to make sure we get in  Seriously, stop reading and book it We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel  It was in a perfect location right in the middle of the old town and a fifteen minute walk from Las Ramblas  The hotel itself is clean, attractive and is highly recommended by us  We did not eat there as there are so many good restaurants round about  The food market in Las Ramblas has an abundance of fresh fruits etc so this was a good place to sit and eat breakfast amongst the locals  I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, the only thing I would advise is to confirm your bookings before arrival as there was a discrepancy with ours Having booked Banys on the recommendation of a colleague we were a bit concerned having read some of the less than positive reviews on this site, however we can only say we had a fabulous time here with no problems at all  We had booked one of the suites and on arrival the receptionist carried my wife\\'s case to our room which was less than a minute away from the main hotel  The suites are entered through two iron security gates and up a a staircase  We were quite happy that these gates were in place as the road that the Hotel is located on is very busy with pedestrians and having left quite a lot of electrical equipment in the room the extra security gives additional peace of mind  We stayed in suite A1 and it was very similar to the photos shown on the website  We did find that the suite was quite dark although we did think that this was in keeping with the style of the room and there were numerous lamps and spotlights to brighten things up  As mentioned in previous reviews there is a fridge in the room stocked with still and sparkling water and any used bottles are replaced free of charge each day  On the mezzanine level there was a large couch and a lamp which was perfect for relaxing and applying sun tan lotion ! The bathroom was quite small containing a shower and toilet with the sink being located outside We certainly did not have any problems with a lack of hot water as had been reported by a previous reviewer  The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic, being set in the vibrant El Born distict of the gothic quarter  There are numerous shops, bars and restaurants nearby, but we especially liked Les Quinze Nits located about a 10 minute walk away in Placa Reial  The menu is quite simple but everything we tried was absolutely delicious - so much so that we ate there 5 times ! It is also unbelivable value for money - 3 course meal for two with a bottle of wine and coffees was about 40 Euros ! The restaurant is really popular with queues starting about 30 minutes before opening time - we estimated that there must have been about 100 people in front of us one night, but having been seated, the service was fantastic  Another favorite and highly recomended place is La Vinya del Senyor located in Placa de Santa Maria which as would be expected only serves wines  The staff were extremely knowledgable and helpful and as a lover of dessert wines we discovered the ultimate in Castano Dulce which was absolutely amazing  All in all this was one of the most enjoyable holidays my wife and I have had in a long time and based on our experiences would recommend Banys Orientals and Barcelona to everybody, it is unbeatable for value and second to none for location My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at The Banys Oriental Hotel for a long weekend in Barcelona  We selected the hotel based on location and price  We stayed in one of the suites which were located in another building a couple of minutes walk away The entrance/lobby to this building was drab and dark with a tiny lift serving the suites  The staircase was like a fire escape and the layout complicated  It was very unwelcoming  The suite was a decent size and the bed was very comfortable  The bathroom looked good but using the facilities was tricky  The shower leaked all over the floor and the glass door leading to the toilet was heavy and difficult to open  We ate breakfast in the hotel on the first morning which was dreadful  The buffet selection was poor and there were cleaning products left by the cleaner stacked in a corner smelling of bleach  The Taller de Tapas on the same street serves an excellent breakfast so we ate there instead  Overall the hotel was reasonable value for money but we would not return I have very mixed feelings about Hotel Banys Orientals  Pros: Forget the Ramblas, the hotel is in the best part of Barcelona, El Born  More restaurants, wine bars and medieval ambience than one could shake a leg of ham at  The adjoining restaurant was one of our favorites (we eat there twice)  The free water was nice and often needed  Cool suites with modern look and the price was right  Cons: The sleek modern look was better viewed from the Internet than in person  For example, instead of removing the old decor, i e , sinks, cabinets, etc  the hotel simply installed false walls to cover it up; a bit strange  This leads to the biggest con, because of limited space do to the false walls, they only installed a 10-gallon hot water heater  It lasted exactly 9 minutes; we timed it, and took 4 hours to reheat  We either showered together (very small shower) or, one at night and one in the mourning  The suite had a large two-story window that looked out at the staircase, not much of a view  Noise wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much of an issue but in the busy season I could see how it would be  The staff is young and not very helpful or knowledgeable  Things to be aware of: There are two different suite buildings, one building is right next to the main hotel and the other is 300 yards away, down a small dark alley  After complaining about the limited hot water, the hotel offered to move us to one of the suites down the street, which has newer hot water systems  We got an uneasy feeling about the location and declined  So uneasy, in fact, we would rather take 4-minute shows than stay there  As for the standard rooms located in the main building, they seemed fine but small  However, be aware many rooms and even entire floors were unfinished  Guests had to climb over paint cans and other debris to get to there rooms  Like my title, I have mixed feelings, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a hotel for everyone, certainly not travels how require attentive staff and hassle free rooms  If this hotel was located anywhere else I would give it 1 star but location, location, location\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Just returned from a fantastic 2 night stay at hotel Bany\\'s Orientals- we were a largegroup of 25 on my hen party weekend and had a mixture of twin rooms and suites  All were modern in style and clean and the free water was a great bonus! I was worried the suites would be too far away from the main hotel building but this is not the case- they are literally a stones throw away from the front entrance  Breakfast is continental and really nice  Location- great, close to harbour, cathedral, shops, bars and restaurants  I would definitely stay here again- next time with my hubby! Barcelona is GORGEOUS!!This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had  The hotel is quite nice looking and the rooms are quite nice - as long as your not put in a single room under the staircase  The receptionists were far more interested in their own appearance than helping with any problems we may have had  Barcelona is a great city but this hotel ruined our trip and New Year    stay away!! Oh the food in the restaurant is great    but unfortunately the restaurant has very little to do with the hotel Stayed at the Banys Orientals in July 2005 with a hen party  Enjoyed 2 nights there  Location excellent  Clean comfortable rooms with ultra modern decor  Nice large walk in shower  Free chilled bottled water was a godsend with a huge fridge on each landing full of the stuff  Located in the heart of the bario gothic near the cathedral  Very central for sightseeing  Liked it so much went back again in Sept  2005 with partner  Good value hotel Just returned from Hotel Banys Orientals after a 2 night stay for my hen weekend  We stayed in the suites which are about 5 minutes from the main hotel, they are fantastic! We booked 3 suites for 8 of us, all 3 suites were slightly different but all equally as nice  The main bedroom was huge with a big 4-poster style bed with 2 single matresses, there was also a tv, desk and fridge in the room  We also had a room with a single bed and then the bathroom which was very modern (the best power shower I\\'ve ever had!)  We had 3 patio doors which led out onto a long balcony so you could see the goings on in the street  The rooms were very clean, I defnately have no complaints about this hotel and will hopefully be returning very soon  The location is excellent with lots of bar and cafe\\'s nearby, also just 5 mins taxi away from la ramblas  Would highly recommend this hotel to anybody My friends and I just returned from the Banys Oriental  We stayed there from Feb  19 - 22nd  First off, the location is unbelievably great  You\\'re walking distance to almost everything  I can\\'t comment on Breakfast, since we did not pay for that as we planned to have coffee and whatever in a local cafe daily  and there are MANY local cafe\\'s to grab a bite at  The best coffee is at a franchise near the hotel called Cappachino  Anyway, we asked for two adjoining rooms and unfortunately, they did not have two next door to each other the day we arrived  But the hotel did arrange for us to be together (next door to one another) from the second day until we left  They even moved my friends luggage  The rooms are basically clean and simple  Much better than a motel 6 and you certainly cannot expect the Ritz Carlton for the price you\\'re paying at Banys  WE had a fantastically comfortable bed, roomy bathrooms and yes, there is definitely a musty smell but it did not bother us  We had a great view of the street below and it was NOT noisy as other areas  For 95Euros, you\\'re getting a steal  The best bargain though, is the Banys restaurant right next door  Do yourself a favor and make a reservation  The place always has a line to get in      the food is out of this world  Enjoy your trip if you\\'re headed out to this wonderful little world  saytheword (NYC)We stayed in Banys for two nights, just to spend the Weekend in Barcelona and found it very nice and comfortable  I lived for one year in Barcelona and know the city centre very well  Bany Orientals is located perfectly in the heart of the G\\xc3\\xb3tico Area and you really find everything near to you (even Metro and Bus)  The value you get for the money you pay is above average for Barcelona  Even for bad Hostals I paid only 20 EUR less, compared to Banys Orientals, if you like the Hostal rooms with own bathroom  The Hotel has a very nice abstract and cosy style, the breakfast is very good and the service as well  If you get a room to the street it is of corse not very silent, but this is the charme of the mediteranean City of Barcelona  Some small things of course are nice to see, but not very good to use  The lightning of the bathroom indeed should be improved (especially at the sink and mirror), but this wasn\\xc2\\xb4t really a problem  I felt very good \"at home\" in the Banys Orientals rooms  Especially our room had two levels  Entering you could go directly in the bathroom/WC  Going some steps down (wooden steps in the material of the floor, very nice!) there was a hugh bed that was of a good quality  A small balcony to look, what is going on on the street, a big window with good curtains (no light enters at morning!) a small table with nice lamps on it, pictures on the wall - all those things made it overall a nice space to stay  Not very big, but to relax after walks through Barcelona  I will go to BO again  Definitely Bany\\'s Orientals is an absolutely beautiful hotel! It\\'s designed and decorated with a kind of stylish simplicity that I associate with the West\\'s take on the East (particularly Japan)  I stayed for business, so I was thrilled that it was not just an identical box business hotel  The location was excellent, as well  The included breakfast was great, including items sure to please Spaniards, Brits, and Americans alike, plus it was served until fairly late so it was very convenient  The bed was comfortable, with clean soft linens  Unfortunately, all the goodness was packed into the superficial level, leaving a lot to be desired  There was no internet service available in the hotel, the heating/cooling unit was so high tech that it was impossible to program, and there was no overhead light so even with every lamp turned on and the curtains open, it was difficult to see  The bathroom is also beautifully useless  The sink design makes one very apt to spray themselves or the room, the shower design makes that absolutely certain, and the lack of ventilation left me with a thin film of condensation on every surface when I finished After staying in the Casa Camper before moving to Banys Orientals, we were not overly excited to be checking in  But we knew that there is a reason why Banys charges E100 and Camper E200! When we arrived, we were informed that the hotel does not know about our booking! Fortunately I had a printout of an email confirmation, which, upon presentation, quickly sorted out the confusion  We actually hoped that they did not have any rooms, so that we had a reason to go back to the Camper (which in reality we could not afford for another night!) In the end, we got one of the streetfacing rooms on the first floor, which was nice and spacious  Pros: - Nice design, although the monochrome colours seemed a bit dull after the bright reds of the Camper  - Free water good since Barcelona\\'s tastes awful  - Although the hotel does not have wi-fi, I was given an ethernet cable to connect to the port in the room  This worked perfectly  - Nice bathroom, although some of the tiles in the shower need to be replaced  Strange double taps? Cons - Soundproofing  The problem bothered us at first, but we got used to it  One can hear people talking on the street even with all the windows closed  Occasionaly we could hear conversations and tv in the room next door  The problem is manageable and not quite as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be  All in all, at about E100 for a double, Banys Orientals is a sobre choice if one of your prerequisites is nice design  I have done a lot of research on boutique hotels in Barcelona in this pricerange, and this still seems to be the best choice Yes, the bathrooms smell - though I think it\\'s less due to lack of cleanliness and more due to a lack of ventilation - and yes there\\'s a bit of noise from the uncarpeted hallways and streets outside, but the location is unparalleled, and the price is unbeatable  While you don\\'t get amenities like room service or laundry, you do get a very helpful staff and all the bottled water you can drink  And, for not too much more money, the suites are huge with nicer bathrooms - though they are in buildings separate from the main hotel  I\\'ll go back for a 4th trip  The only thing I\\'d change would be giving out a set of earplugs with each room - we brought our own and it makes all the differnce in the world If you\\'re looking for a stylish modern hotel with a high tech look straight from Architectural Digest, this is for you  The rates are reasonable too  A nice experience and conveniently located, particularly if you\\'re looking for a stopover before joiing a ship in the port  Would return again anytime My husband and I went to Spain for our honeymoon and stayed in one of the suites at the Hotel Banys Oriental for six nights  The suites are not in the same building as the hotel, which we knew  However, when we entered the building where the suites were located, it was literally like entering a prison  We passed through a metal gate door which you have to slam shut for it to lock  Then we walked up two flights of stairs into a cement courtyard (we called it the dungeon) to get to our room  There was a loud refrigerator there holding the bottled water  There were no plants, very little lighting (which seemed dangerous since the door was hardly ever closed and locked), no chairs or table -- just a dark, windy, and a liitle scary area to pass through before entering your room  Fortunately we were on the first level  Other guests had to climb an enormous metal staircase with their luggage to get to their rooms -- there is no elevator  There are also no employees in the suite building  The room did look like the pictures we have seen online, but some things have to be noted in person  The floors which appear to be hardwood, are in fact, vinyl - made to look like wood  This would have been okay (albeit a little cheesy) except that they were filthy and bumpy  The lighting in the room, the bathroom, and the loft space was so poor that it was quite depressing  There is no overhead lighting - only one floor lamp (which we moved down from the loft because we literally couldn\\'t see) and 2 table lamps, all with low wattage bulbs  The bed frame was a made out of a cheap wood painted black -- ikea-esque, but worse, with screws sticking out on the bottom  There were 2 strange clip lights on the bed frame that were like car headlights  As it was November, and getting cold, we could understand the room being a bit cold, but our room was unbearably cold  We turned the temperature up as high as it could go, and it was still too chilly to stay in there any longer than we had to  The loft space was boiling hot, and the downstairs was icy  Not to mention that the room was so dark and dreary that we wanted to be anywhere else  We tried to change hotels, but were unable to find anything  We called to tell them about the lighting situation and the freezing temp, and they said that it would be warmer and brighter in the morning with the light streaming through the windows  That never happened, even on a bright sunny day  It was dark, cold and depressing for the duration of our stay  When we say dark, I mean, we could not see our clothes in the suitcase! We asked to change rooms, but nothing was available  The bathroom was more of the same -- dark and cold -- very unpleasant  The boiler broke in our room the day before we left and we had no hot water  They said that it could not be fixed until the following day when we were checking out anyway  We were also unsure of the cleanliness of everything  For the six days that we were there, the sink area was never cleaned -- made us wonder what else was never cleaned  We know that they did not change the sheets on the bed either  The breakfast, although plentiful was a bit disappointing  It seemed as though not everything was so fresh -- some stale bread, cheese that sat out for too long  But overall we were able to eat well enough to start our day  We did not have any English channels on our tv which would have been nice to have during siesta time  There were a few upsides -- the price, location, and the free bottled water  We would not recommend this hotel for more than 2 nights  We also suggest staying in the main hotel instead of the suites  Our overall opinion was that on the surface everything looks good, but underneath there was not much quality I stayed at this hotel for three week day nights in early November  E90 per night  I was by myself but had a double room (which I had booked because a single was not available)  The room was on the second floor (105) at the back and was very quiet  I know that others have complained about the thin walls and noise from outside but I heard nothing  Excellent cold breakfast buffet for E9 60 - cereals, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheese, juice, coffee etc  The staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke English  There was a safe in the room (enter a 4 digit combination)  Room was all black and white decorations and was very clean  Very nice having free cold bottled water available  The location was excellent - steps from the Jaume subway station and the Cathedral  I would certainly stay there again  andrewI have to say that most of the reviews are spot on  IT IS a lovely little hotel, great value, great location, nice staff, and I would without a doubt stay there again  They are a couple of things that others have mentioned which are also true, thin walls (felt like someone else was in the room) and it was a bit of a tight squeeze around the bed, but that was it  I had friends staying in one of the suites and that was great, so if you want a bit more of a treat for an extra 30 euros book one of those My girlfriend and i stayed one night in this cute \"W\"esque hotel; i would definitely stay here again; it was a great value at 90 euro per night for a double  Most, not all, of the staff were friendly and helpful  The rooms were very clean as were the bathrooms  It is in a great location near the Gothic area as well as the trains  Walking distance to plaza catalunya & tons of shopping & restaurants!!! There was a huge refridgerator with complimentary bottled water in the hallway which was definitely a plus! We did not have the chance to eat in the restaurant in the hotel, but it looked very cute! Walls were thin but we did not have any trouble as far as noisy neighbors  Television had english channels (which we didn\\'t find anywhere else) booked this hotel on trip advisor suggestion  sent visa number as confirmation, when arrived did not have our booking and we had to find alternative accom, when we arrived home found they had deducted amount from our visa account, sent an email to them and so far have not had any reply  We are currently trying to recover funds through the bank  I would definatly not advise using this hotel  Went to hotel colon which was fantastic  Cheryl Wilsmore Stylish hotel for a very good price (93 euro/night for double room excluding tax)  Polite and efficient staff  Excellent location  Free water on all floors (still/sparkling)  Close to metro  HOWEVER, bathroom clean but not spotless (shower was powerful though)  Tiles and grouting are black so may be even less clean than appears  Most of space in room was taken up with the large double bed  And finally the rooms are very noisy  We moved from room 100 (as we may as well have been sleeping on the street-noise began from about 7 am) to room 304 (which had slightly less noise from street but transmitted every sound from our neighbours room-and they were not noisy)  Overall would probably not return   or return with earplugs '"
