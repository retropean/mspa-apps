    "In this last required assignment you'll be examining email data from the Enron Corporation, which infamously collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001.  The firm filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2 of that year.  The email data was compiled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for investigative and litigation purposes.  It is now available from diverse sources and in various forms, and it has been researched by many. You can find out about this data at:\n",

The Python ES clients that are available include `elasticsearch` and `elasticsearch_dsl`.  See the ES Jupyter notebooks on Canvas for guidance on connecting to and using ES on the SSCC using the Python `elasticsearch` client.  This is the \"official\" ES client.  You might find `elasticsearch_dsl` to be a bit more intuitive.  Give it a try if you want."

    "Upon last inspection the `enron` ES index had about 250,000 messages in it.   A smaller number of these mention an email address for Ken Lay in a message header.  Email addresses for Lay may be like `klay@enron.com` or some variation on this.  He may have used more than one email address. (Don't many of us?) Some of his addresses may mention his corporate title rather than his name. The challenge here is to identify _all_ messages _to_ or _from_ Ken Lay.  (You don't need to consider any that cc'd or bcc'd him.)\n",

This docment includes the 'mapping' of the `enron` index.  The Jupyter notebooks on Canvas provide you with examples of accessing the index and will give you a look at the messages in it."
