# Individual Assignment 1 Jump-Start Code (Word Clouds Only)

# here we show how to make a word cloud for a set of text documents
# the documents should be plain text with UTF-8 encoding
# they should be given the extension .txt
# and stored under a directory/folder named text_documents

# you can execute this program from R by typing
# source("run_word_cloud_jump_start_v001.R")
# but first identify the computer environment 
# to begin identify the computer environment as windows versus max/linux
# comment out the system that does not apply
#windows_system <- FALSE  # setting for Max and Linux
windows_system <- TRUE  # setting for Windows

# set the workspace location to be the directory where
# this program resides, with text_documents as a subdirectory/folder

# ensure that wordcloud and tm packages have been installed into R  
# prior to executing these commands 
library(wordcloud)  # bring wordcloud package into workspace
library(tm)  # bring text analytics tools into workspace

# note. there may be other text analytics and text processing 
# packages to install in later jump-start examples

# much of the following code is associated with file manipulation
# the code is designed to work on either Mac/Linux or windows_system
# but we need to specify the type of computer system prior to execution
# locate yourself in working directory that has corpus directory
# and identify the directory labeled "corpus"

# define data frame of words from files in directory_location
# words are associated with the file names in the text_documents directory
text_data_frame <- NULL
for (ifile in seq(along = file_names)) { # begin for-loop for text objects
    # define the file name within the directory text_documents
