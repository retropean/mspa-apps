# Preliminary note about data preparation
#
# The first two records of the original link file
# contains vertices referenced by a zero index.
# For R network algorithms we need to ensure that
# these the from- and to-node identifiers are 
# treated as character strings, not integers.
# We will eliminate these two records and any others
# with zero indices so that names and indices allign.

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Read in list of links... (from-node, to-node) pairs
