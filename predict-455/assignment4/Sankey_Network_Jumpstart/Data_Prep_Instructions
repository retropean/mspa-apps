Preparing data for Sankey Network Diagram exercise
Chicago City Budget Example

	1) Obtain data online
		https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2014-Budget-Ordinance-Appropriations/ub6s-xy6e/data

	2) Examine data
		"DATA" tab on Chicago_Budget_2014.xlsx

	3) Determine which fields you'd like to include in your diagram
		For this exercise, we've selected FUND_TYPE, DEPARTMENT_DESCRIPTION and ORDINANCE_2014_AMOUNT

	4) Excel data prep
		a) Using Excel, create a pivot table of the fields you're interested in 
			See "Pivot" worksheet for an example
		b) Copy all of the node names (column A) and paste them on a separate tab
			To ensure you don't have repitition of names, remove duplicates
			You may want to format the names further, which can be done manually or using Excel (in this example, the =lower() function was used to convert text to all lowercase)
		c) Give each node name a unique numerical value starting at 0 and going +1 until completed
		d) Create a second table that identifies the sources, targets and values
			Source = node to the left
			Target = node to the right
			Value = numerical value associated with the source/target combination
			Sources and Targets should be identified by their numerical values established in 4c
		e) You should now have two tables
			One with just one column that should be called "nodes"
			One with just three columns that should be called "links"
		f) Use Excel's concatenate function to help you write code for json
			See volumns B through I on "Transformed_Data" worksheet in Chicago_Budget_2014.xlsx

	5) Create json file
		a) Copy the resulting values for your "nodes" and "links" tables from step 4f
		b) Paste this text into a text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom
			Alternatively, you may use a converter such as https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/
		c) Save as a .json file

	You should now be ready to leverage the jump-start code provided with only minor edits needed.
